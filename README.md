Patchwork automates development gruntwork like PR reviews, bug fixing, security patching, and more using a self-hosted CLI agent and your preferred LLMs.

## Key Components

- **Steps**: Reusable atomic actions like create PR, commit changes or call an LLM.
- **Prompt Templates**: Customizable LLM prompts optimized for a chore like library updates, code generation, issue analysis or vulnerability remediation.
- **Patchflows**: LLM-assisted automations such as PR reviews, code fixing, documentation etc. built by combining steps and prompts.

Patchflows can be run locally in your CLI and IDE, or as part of your CI/CD pipeline. There are [several patchflows available](#patchflows) out of the box, and you can always [create your own](#contributing).

## Demo

## Installation

### Using Pip

Patchwork is available on PyPI and can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install 'patchwork-cli[all]' --upgrade
```

The following optional dependency groups are available.

- `security`: Installs `semgrep` and `depscan` with `pip install 'patchwork-cli[security]'` and is required for **AutoFix** and **DependencyUpgrade** patchflows.
- `rag`: Installs `chromadb` with `pip install 'patchwork-cli[rag]'` and is required for the **ResolveIssue** patchflow.
- `notifications`: Used by steps sending notifications, e.g. slack messages.
- `all`: installs everything.
- Not specifying any dependency group (`pip install patchwork-cli`) will install a core set of dependencies that are sufficient to run the **GenerateDocstring**, **PRReview** and **GenerateREADME** patchflows.

### Using Poetry

If you'd like to build from source using poetry, please see detailed documentation [here](INSTALL.md) .

## Patchwork CLI

The CLI runs Patchflows, as follows:

```
patchwork <PatchFlow> <?Arguments>
```

Where
- **Arguments**: Allow for overriding default/optional attributes of the Patchflow in the format of `key=value`. If `key` does not have any value, it is considered a boolean `True` flag.

### Example

For an AutoFix patchflow which patches vulnerabilities based on a scan using Semgrep:

```bash
patchwork AutoFix openai_api_key=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY> github_api_key=<YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>
```

The above command defaults to patching code in the current directory by running Semgrep to identify the vulnerabilities. You can view the `default.yml` [file](patchwork/patchflows/AutoFix/defaults.yml) for the list of configurations you can set to manage the AutoFix patchflow. For more details on how you can use a personal access token from GitHub on CLI, can read [this](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#using-a-personal-access-token-on-the-command-line). 

You can replace the OpenAI key with a key from our managed service
by signing in at [https://app.patched.codes/signin](https://app.patched.codes/signin) and generating an API key from the integrations tab. You can then call the patchflow with the key as follows:

```bash
patchwork AutoFix patched_api_key=<YOUR_PATCHED_API_KEY> github_api_key=<YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>
```

To use Google's models you can set the `google_api_key` and `model`, this is useful if you want to work with large contexts as the `gemini-pro-1.5` model supports an input context length of 1 million tokens. 

The [patchwork-template](https://github.com/patched-codes/patchwork-configs) repository contains the default configuration and prompts for all the patchflows. You can clone that repo and pass it as a flag to the CLI:

```bash
patchwork AutoFix --config /path/to/patchwork-configs/patchflows
```

## Using open source models

Patchwork supports any OpenAI compatible endpoint, allowing use of any LLM from various providers like Groq, Together AI, or Hugging Face. 

E.g. to use Llama 3.1 405B from Groq.com run:

```
patchwork AutoFix client_base_url=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1 openai_api_key=your_groq_key model=llama-3.1-405b-reasoning
```

You can also use a config file to do the same. To use Llama 3.1 405B from Hugging Face, create a config.yml file:

```yaml
openai_api_key: your_hf_token
client_base_url: https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-FP8/v1
model: Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-FP8
```

And run as:

```
patchwork AutoFix --config=/path/to/config.yml
```

This allows you to run local models via `llama.cpp`, `ollama`, `vllm` or `tgi`. For instance, you can run Llama 3.1 8B locally using `llama_cpp.server`:

```
python -m llama_cpp.server --hf_model_repo_id bullerwins/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF --model 'Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf' --chat_format chatml
```

Then run your patchflow:

```
patchwork AutoFix client_base_url=https://localhost/v1 openai_api_key=no_key_local_model
```

## Patchflows

Patchwork comes with predefined patchflows, with more added over time. Sample patchflows include:

- [**GenerateDocstring**](patchwork/patchflows/GenerateDocstring): Generate docstrings for methods in your code.
- [**AutoFix**](patchwork/patchflows/AutoFix): Generate and apply fixes to code vulnerabilities in a repository.
- [**PRReview**](patchwork/patchflows/PRReview): On PR creation, extract code diff, summarize changes, and comment on PR.
- [**GenerateREADME**](patchwork/patchflows/GenerateREADME): Create a README markdown file for a given folder, to add documentation to your repository.
- [**DependencyUpgrade**](patchwork/patchflows/DependencyUpgrade): Update your dependencies from vulnerable to fixed versions.
- [**ResolveIssue**](patchwork/patchflows/ResolveIssue): Identify the files in your repository that need to be updated to resolve an issue (or bug) and create a PR to fix it.

## Prompt Templates

Prompt templates are used by patchflows and passed as queries to LLMs. Templates contain prompts with placeholder variables enclosed by `{{}}` which are replaced by the data from the steps or inputs on every run. 

Below is a sample prompt template:

```json
{
  "id": "diffreview_summary",
    "prompts": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Summarize the following code change descriptions in 1 paragraph. {{diffreviews}}"
      }
    ]
}
```

Each patchflow comes with an optimized default prompt template. But you can specify your own using the `prompt_template_file=/path/to/prompt/template/file` option. 

## Contributing

Contributions for new patchflows and steps, or to the core framework are welcome. Please look at open issues for details.

- To create a new patchflow, follow [these instructions](patchwork/patchflows/README.md).
- To create a new step, follow [these instructions](patchwork/steps/README.md).

We also provide a chat assistant to help you create new steps and patchflows easily. 

- [Patchwork Assistant on HuggingChat](https://hf.co/chat/assistant/66322701fd4787e0c1f7696b) (based on Llama-3)

## Roadmap
