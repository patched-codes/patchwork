# Refined Code Style Guidelines

## 1. Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive and consistent naming for variables, functions, and classes.

## 2. Code Structure
- Maintain consistent function signatures across different implementations of the same interface.
- Break down complex logic into smaller, more manageable functions (modularization).
- Use consistent indentation and line breaks, especially in function definitions and method calls.

## 3. Documentation
- Add or update inline comments and docstrings for new or modified functions.
- Provide comprehensive documentation for modules, including detailed README.md files.
- Use consistent docstring guidelines across the project.
- Implement and maintain up-to-date type hints, especially for function parameters and return types.

## 4. Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling and logging for edge cases and exceptions.
- Include fallback mechanisms for potentially missing data.

## 5. Security
- Implement whitelists for module imports to prevent arbitrary code execution.

## 6. Dependency Management
- Carefully manage and update dependencies in the project configuration.
- Keep dependencies up-to-date and secure.

## 7. Data Handling
- Use a standardized approach to handling JSON data and schemas across different modules.

## 8. Version Control
- Use proper version control practices, including meaningful commit messages and version updates.
- Prefer workflow dispatch input for version control instead of tags.

## 9. Logging
- Consistently import and use the logger across all modules.

These refined guidelines combine similar rules, remove redundancies, and ensure each guideline is categorized and clear. The categories have been adjusted to better fit the consolidated guidelines, with "Performance" removed as it wasn't explicitly addressed in the original list, and "Dependency Management", "Data Handling", "Version Control", and "Logging" added as new categories to accommodate specific guidelines that didn't fit into the original categories.
