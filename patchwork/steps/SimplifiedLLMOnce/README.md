## SimplifiedLLMOnce Module

### Inputs
- This code defines `SimplifiedLLMOnceInputs` and `__SimplifiedLLMOnceInputsRequired` data classes containing input specifications for a step in a workflow.
- Inputs include data related to prompting users, API keys, model responses, and response partitions.

### Outputs
- This code defines `SimplifiedLLMOnceOutputs` as a data class specifying the outputs produced by the step.
- Outputs include details like the prompted text, the response from OpenAI, and extracted model responses.
- The `SimplifiedLLMOnce` class contains a method `run()` that orchestrates the logic for this step by interacting with other step classes like `PreparePrompt`, `CallLLM`, and `ExtractModelResponse`.

### Usage
- This module appears to be part of a larger system for running an automated workflow involving a simplified language model.
- The `SimplifiedLLMOnce` class likely acts as a step in this workflow, taking specific inputs, executing actions based on these inputs, and producing a structured output for downstream processing.
- Inputs to the class can be validated, and the `run()` method orchestrates the interactions with other steps to fetch responses, process them, and provide a coherent output.

### Additional Information
- The code integrates with other utility functions and steps to effectively handle the workflow logic, including handling data in JSON format.
- The typing module is used to enforce type hints in the input and output specifications, providing clarity on the expected data structures.
