## Documentation for patchwork/steps/LLM/LLM.py

### Inputs
- This code defines a class `LLM` that requires inputs conforming to the specified structure defined in the `LLMInputs` class from `typed.py`.

### Outputs
- The `run` method of the `LLM` class executes a series of steps including `PreparePrompt`, `CallLLM`, and `ExtractModelResponse` to generate outputs as defined in the `LLMOutputs` class from `typed.py`.

### Usage
The `LLM` class seems to be a part of a larger system for natural language processing tasks. It takes structured inputs, performs specific steps on the data, and provides processed outputs for further consumption within the system.
