# ManageEngineAgent Code Documentation

## Overview

The provided code represents an implementation of a `ManageEngineAgent`, a software component designed to interact with the ManageEngine ServiceDesk via APIs. It uses advanced strategies to handle and manipulate service desk tickets, applying modularized tools and strategies to achieve seamless communication with the ServiceDesk API. The implementation consists of two main files: `typed.py` and `ManageEngineAgent.py`.

## Structure

### `typed.py`

This file defines data structures for inputs and outputs of the `ManageEngineAgent`. These structures use Python's `TypedDict` for type safety and annotations to help with configuration requirements and constraints.

#### Inputs

- **me_access_token** (`str`): Required. OAuth token for authenticating with ManageEngine.
- **user_prompt** (`str`): Required. Prompt for the agent.
- **prompt_value** (`Dict[str, Any]`): Required. Dictionary containing values for the user prompt.

- **max_agent_calls** (`int`): Optional. Maximum number of agent calls allowed.
- **openai_api_key** (`str`): Optional. API key for OpenAI; may be used alternatively with other defined keys.
- **anthropic_api_key** (`str`): Optional. API key, alternative to others.
- **google_api_key** (`str`): Optional. API key, alternative to others.
- **system_prompt** (`Optional[str]`): Optional. Custom system prompt message.
- **example_json** (`Optional[Dict]`): Optional. Example JSON for input scenarios.

#### Outputs

- **conversation_history** (`List[Dict]`): History of conversations.
- **tool_records** (`List[Dict]`): Records of each tool action.
- **request_tokens** (`int`): Count of tokens used for requests.
- **response_tokens** (`int`): Count of tokens used for responses.

### `ManageEngineAgent.py`

This file defines the `ManageEngineAgent` class, responsible for executing and managing interactions with the ManageEngine ServiceDesk API using a conversational agent strategy.

#### Key Operations

- **Initialization**:
  - Checks for required inputs (`me_access_token`, `user_prompt`).
  - Sets up headers for authentication with ManageEngine.
  - Determines conversation limits and prepares system prompts.

- **Configuration**:
  - Configures an asynchronous Large Language Model (LLM) client with `AioLlmClient`.
  - Uses an `AgenticStrategyV2` approach to further define agent configurations tailored for ManageEngine tasks.
  - Utilizes handling through tools like `APIRequestTool` to simulate API requests and operations.

- **Execution**:
  - The `run` method runs the agentic strategy constrained within conversation limits and returns results along with token usage statistics.

### Usage

The `ManageEngineAgent` can be used as part of a larger system performing managed IT services. It automates the interaction with the ManageEngine ServiceDesk, handling ticket creation, retrieval, and modification via an API, leveraging a conversational interface powered by AI models.

Based on inputs, such as API keys and prompts, the `ManageEngineAgent` facilitates complex multiturn interactions, making it suitable for advanced Help Desk applications where seamless integration and automated reasoning with an existing IT infrastructure are required. 

## Summary

The `ManageEngineAgent` implementation provides a robust framework for automated interactions with ManageEngine ServiceDesk. By encapsulating complex logic into structured input and output forms and applying a strategic conversational agent design, this codebase supports scalable, efficient help desk operations in a contemporary IT environment.
