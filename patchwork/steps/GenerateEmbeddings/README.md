# Summary of `GenerateEmbeddings.py` 

## Inputs:
- The code imports necessary modules and functions.
- Defines a function `filter_by_extension` to filter files by their extensions.
- Defines a function `split_text` to split a document text into chunks.
- Creates a class `GenerateEmbeddings` that inherits from `Step`.
    - Constructor `__init__` initializes the class instance with required data.
    - Method `run` processes documents for embedding generation.

## Outputs:
- The `GenerateEmbeddings` class processes document texts and embeddings, generates embeddings, and saves them to a database collection.
- Returns an empty dictionary.

## Usage:
1. Import the `GenerateEmbeddings` class from the module.
2. Create an instance of `GenerateEmbeddings` with the required input dictionary.
3. Call the `run` method to generate embeddings for the provided documents and store them in the database collection.
4. Receive the output dictionary indicating the completion of the embeddings generation process.
