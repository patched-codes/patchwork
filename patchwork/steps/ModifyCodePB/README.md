# Patchwork Modify Code Module

This module provides functionality to modify code files based on extracted responses. It contains functions for loading and saving JSON files, handling indentation, and replacing code in files. The main class `ModifyCode` is a step that takes inputs containing code snippets and extracted responses, and then modifies the specified lines in code files with the new extracted code.

## Inputs
- `file_path`: The path to the JSON file containing code snippets.
- `content`: The content to be saved to a file.
- `src`: List of lines representing the original code.
- `target`: List of lines representing the target code.
- `file_path`: Path to the file to be modified.
- `start_line`: Line number to start replacing the code.
- `end_line`: Line number to end replacing the code.
- `new_code`: The new code to replace the specified lines.

## Outputs
- `modified_code_files`: A list of dictionaries containing information about the modified code files like path, start line, end line, and extracted response metadata.
