# Code Documentation

## Inputs

- The code takes inputs in the form of a dictionary passed to the `__init__` method of the `GenerateCodeRepositoryEmbeddings` class.

## Outputs
- The `run` method of the `GenerateCodeRepositoryEmbeddings` class returns a dictionary containing the results of generating embeddings for a code repository.

### Description
- The code is responsible for generating embeddings for code files in a code repository.
- It uses the `git` Python package to interact with the Git repository where the code files are stored.
- The code filters out specific file types based on a whitelist and ignores certain directories based on a blacklist.
- The `hash_text` function generates a SHA-1 hash for the text content of code files.
- The `GenerateCodeRepositoryEmbeddings` class manages the process of generating embeddings for the code repository.
- It fetches code files, reads their content, generates hashes, and interacts with the ChromaDB database to store embeddings and related metadata.
- The results are then passed to the `GenerateEmbeddings` class for further processing.
=======
- The code provides a function `filter_files` that takes an iterable of file paths and filters out files based on directory blacklists.
- The code includes a function `batch` that slices an iterable into batches of a specific size.
- It contains a function `hash_text` that hashes a text string using SHA1.
- The `GenerateCodeRepositoryEmbeddings` class is a step class that requires certain keys in the input dictionary, initializes a client, and defines a `run` method that generates code repository embeddings.

## Outputs
- The `GenerateCodeRepositoryEmbeddings` class generates embeddings for code repositories, processes files, handles ignored files, interacts with a database, and eventually runs a separate `GenerateEmbeddings` step with updated inputs.
