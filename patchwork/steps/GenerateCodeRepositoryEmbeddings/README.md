# Code Documentation

## Inputs
- The code provides a function `filter_files` that takes an iterable of file paths and filters out files based on directory blacklists.
- The code includes a function `batch` that slices an iterable into batches of a specific size.
- It contains a function `hash_text` that hashes a text string using SHA1.
- The `GenerateCodeRepositoryEmbeddings` class is a step class that requires certain keys in the input dictionary, initializes a client, and defines a `run` method that generates code repository embeddings.

## Outputs
- The `GenerateCodeRepositoryEmbeddings` class generates embeddings for code repositories, processes files, handles ignored files, interacts with a database, and eventually runs a separate `GenerateEmbeddings` step with updated inputs.
