## Inputs
The module `typed.py` defines 2 TypedDict classes:
- `PRPBInputsRequired` with required keys for input data related to commit changes and preparing PR.
- `PRPBInputs` extends `PRPBInputsRequired` and includes additional optional keys for various input configurations like branch settings, PR title, PR header, etc.
- `PRPBOutputs` is a TypedDict class defining the expected output keys related to base branch, target branch, PR body, and PR URL.

## File: patchwork/steps/PRPB/PRPB.py
This file contains a class `PRPB` that extends `Step` with input and output class specified as `PRPBInputs` and `PRPBOutputs` respectively. The class initializes by mapping input keys based on certain conditions, processes modified files data, and runs a PR step with the modified files for PR creation.

The code is likely utilized to create a class representing a step in a patchwork process for handling Pull Request (PR) and related activities like committing changes, preparing PR, and creating PR.
