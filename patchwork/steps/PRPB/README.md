# Documentation for PRPB Module

## Overview

The `PRPB` module manages the preparation and creation of pull requests (PRs) by handling the preliminary steps like committing changes, preparing PR titles and bodies, and ultimately creating the PR itself. The module leverages typed dictionaries for input and output validation, ensuring that all necessary configurations and data are provided and processed correctly.

## `patchwork/steps/PRPB/typed.py`

### Inputs
- **`PRPBInputs`**: A class extending `TypedDict` that requires fields like `modified_files` and `path_key`, with optional configurations for branching, PR header, PR title, SCM URLs, and API keys for GitHub and GitLab.

### Outputs
- **`PRPBOutputs`**: A class extending `TypedDict` that defines outputs such as `base_branch`, `target_branch`, `pr_body`, and `pr_url`.

### Code Overview
Defines the structure for inputs and expected outputs using `TypedDict` and type annotations, ensuring proper type-checking and configuration.

## `patchwork/steps/PRPB/__init__.py`

### Code Overview
An empty initialization file.

---

## `patchwork/steps/PRPB/PRPB.py`

### Inputs
- **Instance Initialization**: The `PRPB` class constructor expects a dictionary structured according to the `PRPBInputs`.
- **Key Mappings**: Handles conversion of input files by mapping provided keys to required keys for processing modified files.

### Outputs
- **Run Method**: Returns a dictionary structured according to the `PRPBOutputs`, typically containing URLs and branch information related to the pull request.

### Code Overview
Implements the main logic for handling input preparation (key mapping and modified files conversion) and the execution of creating a pull request using the `PR` step from the `patchwork` module.

With this module, users can automate the process of committing code changes, configuring branch and PR details, and finally creating the pull request by supplying the necessary inputs conforming to the `PRPBInputs` structure. The structured outputs provide all the relevant information needed after the PR process is completed.
