# Documentation: Patchwork PRPB Module

## Overview
This documentation provides a summary of the contents and functionality of the `PRPB` module, part of the `patchwork` package. This module is designed to handle preparation and processing tasks related to pull requests (PRs) by extending general step functionalities of the Patchwork framework.

## Files

### 1. `PRPB.py`

**File Information:**
- **Extension:** .py
- **Language:** Python
- **Size:** 1629 bytes
- **Created:** 2024-09-23 13:24:26
- **Modified:** 2024-09-23 13:24:26

**Description:**
The `PRPB` class, inherited from `Step`, represents a single step in the Patchwork pipeline. It takes various inputs, re-maps them if necessary, and finally executes the step to process pull requests.

#### Inputs
- `inputs`: A dictionary containing various keys required for PR processing such as file paths, comments, and configuration settings.

#### Outputs
- Returns outputs processed by the `PR` class, which typically includes details like the URL of the created PR, branches involved, and body of the PR.

#### Functionality
- **Initialization:** 
  - Re-maps keys based on provided input keys (e.g., `path_key`, `comment_title_key`).
  - Processes the `modified_files` input to conform to expected structure.
- **run method:**
  - Aggregates inputs and invokes the `PR` class.
  - Returns the results of the PR processing, containing PR and branch details.

### 2. `typed.py`

**File Information:**
- **Extension:** .py
- **Language:** Python
- **Size:** 1348 bytes
- **Created:** 2024-09-23 13:24:26
- **Modified:** 2024-09-23 13:24:26

**Description:**
This file defines the input and output type structures for the `PRPB` step using `TypedDict`.

#### Inputs (`PRPBInputs`)
- Required:
  - `modified_files`: List of dictionaries with modified file details.
  - `path_key`: The key used to access the file path from `modified_files`.
- Optional:
  - `comment_title_key`, `comment_message_key`: Keys for accessing comments.
  - Various configuration flags and settings for branching and PR handling like `disable_branch`, `force_branch_creation`, `pr_header`, `pr_title`, etc.

#### Outputs (`PRPBOutputs`)
- Contains commit changes and PR details such as:
  - `base_branch`, `target_branch`: Branches involved in the PR.
  - `pr_body`: Body content of the PR.
  - `pr_url`: URL to the created PR.

### 3. `__init__.py`

**File Information:**
- **Extension:** .py
- **Language:** Python
- **Size:** 0 bytes
- **Created:** 2024-09-23 13:24:26
- **Modified:** 2024-09-23 13:24:26

**Description:**
The `__init__.py` file is present to mark the directory as a package. It does not contain any functional code in this context.

## Usage

The `PRPB` class is used as a step in the Patchwork framework for managing pull requests. Users can:
1. Initialize it with required input parameters.
2. Customize PR and branch handling via optional configuration settings.
3. Execute the step to process PRs and obtain details such as PR URLs and involved branches.

This setup allows Patchwork users to automate and streamline PR management tasks efficiently.
