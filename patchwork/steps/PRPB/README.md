## Code Documentation

### Inputs
- Defined input classes with specific attributes in `typed.py`
- Attributes include information related to modified files, paths, comments, PR settings, and APIs
- `PRPB` class in `PRPB.py` accepts inputs based on `PRPBInputs` class

### Outputs
- Defined output class with attributes for base branch, target branch, PR body, and PR URL in `typed.py`
- `PRPB` class in `PRPB.py` runs PR creation using input data and returns PR outputs

### Usage
- The code provides typed classes for inputs and outputs related to a pull request and its accompanying steps
- The `PRPB` class extends `Step`, accepts input of type `PRPBInputs`, processes the data, and initiates a pull request creation using a subclass `PR` from the `steps` module
- This code could be used in a larger system for automating pull request creation based on specified configurations and manipulating modified files before submitting them
- The `PRPB` class encapsulates the logic for handling the creation of pull requests based on the provided inputs including modified files and PR settings
