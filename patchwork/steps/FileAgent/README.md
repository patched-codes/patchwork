# Documentation for FileAgent Codebase

This documentation provides an overview of the `FileAgent` code elements, their functionality, and how developers can interact with these components within the system. The `FileAgent` is designed to manipulate and analyze files using various tools, leveraging language models to assist in more complex tasks.

## File Structure Overview

The `FileAgent` codebase comprises three primary files:

1. **typed.py**: Defines input and output data structures.
2. **FileAgent.py**: Implements the main agent logic.
3. **__init__.py**: Initializes the `FileAgent` module, currently empty.

## File: `patchwork/steps/FileAgent/typed.py`

### Description

This file defines the data types for inputs and outputs used by the `FileAgent`. It employs Python's `TypedDict` to specify required and optional fields for the configuration of the file agent tasks.

### Inputs

- **task**: A string representing the task to be performed by the agent. *(Required)*

- **base_path**: A string indicating the path to the directory where files are located. *(Optional)*

- **prompt_value**: A dictionary containing any additional data required for task execution. *(Optional)*

- **max_llm_calls**: An integer specifying the maximum number of LLM (Language Model) calls allowed. *(Optional, Configuration)*

- **anthropic_api_key**: A string for API authentication, specifically for interactivity with anthropic services. *(Optional, Configuration)*

### Outputs

- **request_tokens**: An integer tracking the number of request tokens utilized.

- **response_tokens**: An integer that records the number of response tokens utilized.

## File: `patchwork/steps/FileAgent/FileAgent.py`

### Description

This file contains the `FileAgent` class, inheriting from a generic `Step` class, and orchestrates complex file manipulation tasks utilizing agent-based strategies. The class integrates with multiple tools to interpret, convert, and analyze file contents.

### Initialization

- Constructs an instance with given `inputs`, setting up the initial file paths and data requirements.
- Configures strategy and agent parameters, including agent models and prompt templates.

### Key Components

- **Agent Configuration**: Sets up agents to interact with tabular formatted files like CSV or Excel, using tools for file conversion and content examination.

### Execution

- The `run()` method executes the strategy using temporary directories to process files.
- Initializes tools such as `FindTextTool`, `FileViewTool`, `In2CSVTool`, and `CSVSQLTool` to accommodate file conversions and queries.
- Employs `AgenticStrategyV2` to carry out defined tasks using a configured language model.

### How to Use

1. **Set Up Inputs**: Specify necessary inputs such as `task`, `base_path`, and others as applicable.
2. **Run Agent**: Call the `run()` method to initiate the file processing and task execution.
3. **Retrieve Outputs**: After running, receive output data like `request_tokens` and `response_tokens`.

## File: `patchwork/steps/FileAgent/__init__.py`

### Description

This file initializes the `FileAgent` module. It is currently empty but could be used for importing submodules or defining package-level variables in the future.

---

This documentation serves as a guide for developers looking to integrate or extend the `FileAgent` functionality within broader systems. By understanding the defined inputs and outputs, as well as the class operations, developers can effectively utilize the `FileAgent` for task automation and file processing purposes.
