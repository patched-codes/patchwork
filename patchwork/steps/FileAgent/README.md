# Overview

The code provided consists of three files that collectively define a `FileAgent`, which is a component for handling file operations with language model capabilities. It is a part of a larger framework called Patchwork.

## File: `typed.py`

### Description

This module defines the input and output types for the `FileAgent`. It uses Python type annotations to ensure the correct structure and types for interactions with the `FileAgent`.

### Inputs

- `task`: A string defining the task that needs to be performed.
- `base_path`: (Optional) A string specifying the base file path for operations.
- `prompt_value`: A dictionary for dynamic data to use in prompts.
- `max_llm_calls`: An integer, annotated as a configuration setting, defining the maximum allowable LLM calls.
- `anthropic_api_key`: A string, annotated as a configuration setting, used for API authentication.

### Outputs

- `request_tokens`: An integer indicating the number of tokens requested.
- `response_tokens`: An integer indicating the number of tokens received in response.

## File: `FileAgent.py`

### Description

This file contains the main logic for the `FileAgent`. It extends the behavior of a `Step` from the Patchwork framework, orchestrating tasks with language models for file-related operations, such as converting and analyzing tabular data formats.

### Key Components

- **Initialization**: Sets up parameters including file paths, API clients, and task-specific prompts.
- **Agent Configuration**: Defines a language agent using `AgentConfig`, specifying a model and a list of tools usable by the agent.
- **Run Method**: Executes the file agent process, utilizing language model strategies and tools for file manipulation tasks.

### Tools and Strategies

- **FileViewTool**: For displaying file content.
- **FindTextTool**: To search text within files.
- **In2CSVTool**: For converting files to CSV format.
- **CSVSQLTool**: For handling SQL-like operations on CSV data.
- **AgenticStrategyV2**: Executes the defined strategy using the model and tools.

## File: `__init__.py`

### Description

This is an empty Python initialization file, indicating that the directory can be treated as a Python package. It suggests modular organization but does not contain additional logic or data.

### Usage

This setup allows developers and engineers to integrate file handling capabilities with automated language model interactions in applications that involve file manipulations, particularly with tabular data. By utilizing predefined input and output types, as well as the strategic application of automated agents, tasks such as data extraction and conversion can be efficiently automated within larger workflows.
