# Documentation: FileAgent Components

This documentation provides an overview of the `FileAgent` components within the `patchwork.steps.FileAgent` package. This package is designed to handle file operations, especially with a focus on tabular data, while leveraging AI models for various tasks.

---

## Overview

The `FileAgent` is a step in a pipeline that processes file-based data, particularly focusing on tasks involving tabular data files such as CSV or Excel formats. The system is augmented with AI capabilities to assist in processing and summarizing the conversations revolving around the data.

The package contains several Python modules: 
1. `typed.py` for input and output data typing.
2. `FileAgent.py` which implements the main logic.
3. `__init__.py` which serves as the package initializer.

## `patchwork/steps/FileAgent/typed.py`

### Description
This module defines the input and output structures for the `FileAgent`. It uses Python's `TypedDict` to enforce type constraints on the expected inputs and outputs.

### Inputs

- **`task`**: `str` - Description of the task to be performed.
- **`base_path`**: `str` (optional) - The base path where files are located, defaulting to the current working directory.
- **`prompt_value`**: `Dict[str, Any]` - Additional data for task phrasing.
- **`max_llm_calls`**: `int` - Configuration for maximum number of language model calls.
- **`openai_api_key`**, **`anthropic_api_key`**, **`google_api_key`**: `str` - API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, respectively. These are configurable with alternative options.

### Outputs

- **`request_tokens`**: `int` - Number of tokens in the request.
- **`response_tokens`**: `int` - Number of tokens in the response.

## `patchwork/steps/FileAgent/FileAgent.py`

### Description
The primary module that implements the `FileAgent`. It extends the `Step` class and integrates with various tools and strategies for handling file data and executing AI-driven tasks. 

### Inputs

The `FileAgent` class inherits its inputs from `FileAgentInputs`, defining the structure for expected task parameters and configuration keys.

### How it Works

1. **Initialization**: Configures the environment, including setting up paths and rendering task templates.
2. **Run Method**: Executes the main logic in a temporary directory, applying the agentic strategy using AI models and associated tools.
3. **Tool Integration**: Integrates with tools like `FindTextTool`, `FileViewTool`, `CSVSQLTool`, and `In2CSVTool` to manage file operations.

### Outputs

Returns a dictionary containing the results and usage metrics from executing the agentic strategy over the provided tasks and files.

## `patchwork/steps/FileAgent/__init__.py`

### Description
A basic module to initialize the `patchwork.steps.FileAgent` package. Currently, it is empty but acts as a placeholder for potential future package-level initializations or imports.

This documentation should serve as a detailed guide for developers or users who are looking to understand or utilize the `FileAgent` within the `patchwork.steps` framework. The modular approach allows for flexible integration and extension of functionalities.
