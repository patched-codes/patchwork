# Documentation for FileAgent Module

This documentation provides an overview of the `FileAgent` module, which consists of various Python files located in the `patchwork/steps/FileAgent` directory. The module focuses on facilitating file-related tasks and operations within a specified directory. Below, you will find details about the code, inputs, and outputs in the provided files.

## File: patchwork/steps/FileAgent/typed.py

### Purpose
This file defines input and output types for the `FileAgent`. It uses Python's `TypedDict` and `Annotated` from the `typing_extensions` module to specify expected configurations and input parameters for the `FileAgent`.

### Inputs
- **task** (`str`): The task description which the agent is supposed to execute.
- **base_path** (`str`): Optional; base directory path where files will be managed.
- **prompt_value** (`Dict[str, Any]`): A dictionary containing dynamic data used in task rendering.
- **max_llm_calls** (`int`): Annotated field indicating configuration for maximum number of LLM (Language Model) calls.
- **anthropic_api_key** (`str`): API key configuration required for accessing Anthropic services.

### Outputs
- **request_tokens** (`int`): Number of request tokens consumed by the agent.
- **response_tokens** (`int`): Number of response tokens returned by the agent.

## File: patchwork/steps/FileAgent/FileAgent.py

### Purpose
The main implementation of the `FileAgent` class responsible for carrying out tasks specified in the inputs. The agent utilizes various tools to process files in tabular formats like CSV, XLS, and XLSX, employing strategies built around Language Model interfacing.

### How It Works
1. **Initialization**: The `FileAgent` is initialized with specific inputs, configuring the base path and task specifics.
2. **Task Execution**: The `run` method executes the task by:
   - Setting up a temporary directory.
   - Using a strategy with configurations (`AgentConfig`) designed for working with files.
   - Converting tabular files to CSV, and utilizing other tools for file handling (e.g., `FileViewTool`, `FindTextTool`).
   - Incorporating Language Models for conversation-based task summarization and auxiliary processing.

### Outputs
The `run` method returns a dictionary containing:
- The execution result of the agentic strategy.
- The usage statistics of the Language Model.

## File: patchwork/steps/FileAgent/__init__.py

### Purpose
An empty initializer file for the `FileAgent` module, indicating that the directory can be treated as a Python package.

By following this documentation, developers and users can understand the `FileAgent` module's role in processing file-based tasks with detailed type specifications for inputs and outputs, leveraging Language Models.
