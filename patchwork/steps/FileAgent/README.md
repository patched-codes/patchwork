# Documentation for FileAgent Code

## Overview

The `FileAgent` module is part of a larger software system designed to work with tabular data file formats such as CSV, XLS, and XLSX. It uses natural language model interactions to perform tasks specified by a user prompt. The agent utilizes several tools to process files, convert formats, and execute text-based queries within files.

## Inputs

### FileAgentInputs

The inputs for `FileAgent` are defined in `patchwork/steps/FileAgent/typed.py` using a `TypedDict`. Key input fields include:

- **task**: `str` - The primary task in text form that the agent is requested to accomplish.
- **base_path**: `str` (optional) - The directory path where files are stored.
- **prompt_value**: `Dict[str, Any]` - A dictionary containing additional data to inform the task.
- **max_llm_calls**: `Annotated[int, StepTypeConfig]` - Configuration setting for maximum allowed LLM (large language model) calls.
- **anthropic_api_key**: `Annotated[str, StepTypeConfig]` - API key for Anthropic services configuration.

## Outputs

### FileAgentOutputs

The outputs from `FileAgent` as specified in `typed.py` consist of:

- **request_tokens**: `int` - The number of tokens used in the request.
- **response_tokens**: `int` - The number of tokens in the response.

## Functionality

The main class `FileAgent` defined in `patchwork/steps/FileAgent/FileAgent.py` extends a `Step` class and integrates input and output classes: `FileAgentInputs` and `FileAgentOutputs`.

### Core Features

- **File Conversion:** Converts tabular formats into CSV using `in2csv_tool`. 
- **CSV Operations:** Utilizes `csvsql_tool` to perform SQL-like operations on CSV data. 
- **File Search and Viewing:** Can search for text within files and provide file views using `FindTextTool` and `FileViewTool`.
- **Task Execution:** The task is interpreted and executed based on a user prompt rendered using `mustache_render`.
- **Strategy and Execution Handling:** Utilizes `AgenticStrategyV2` for orchestrating the task execution workflow among different tools.

### Code Workflow

1. **Initialization:** Sets up required configurations, initializes tools, and prepares the task for execution.
2. **Run Execution:** Within a temporary directory:
   - Configures the agent tools and assigns specific agent configurations.
   - Executes the strategy with a limit on LLM interaction and retrieves the result along with usage metrics.

### Use Case

The `FileAgent` is designed for automated processing of tabular data files, leveraging advanced language model interactions for intelligent handling of file-related tasks defined by user prompts. Ideal for applications that require automated data extraction, transformation, and analysis.

## Additional Information

The `__init__.py` is present but empty, indicating the `FileAgent` module doesn't require explicit initialization logic beyond Python's defaults for this module directory.
