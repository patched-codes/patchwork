# Documentation for FileAgent Module

This documentation provides an overview of the `FileAgent` module found in the `patchwork.steps.FileAgent` package. It describes the purpose of the code, its inputs, and outputs, with a focus on enabling effective use of the `FileAgent` class.

## Overview

The `FileAgent` module is designed to process and handle file operations involving tabular data formats such as CSV, XLS, and XLSX. It uses a strategy pattern with language model integration to assist in tasks related to data manipulation and analysis. The module leverages several tools for file conversion and querying, facilitating enhanced data handling capabilities.

## File: `typed.py`

### Description

Defines the input and output structures for the `FileAgent` class using Python's type hinting features. It specifies what input parameters are required and what outputs can be expected when using the agent.

### Inputs

- **Task** (`str`): The primary task description that the FileAgent needs to execute.
- **Base_path** (`str`): Optional path where files are located, defaulting to the current working directory.
- **Prompt_value** (`Dict[str, Any]`): A dictionary of additional values used for prompt rendering.
- **Max_llm_calls** (`Annotated[int]`): Config attribute for the maximum number of calls to the language model.
- **Anthropic_api_key** (`Annotated[str]`): Config attribute for API authentication.

### Outputs

- **Request_tokens** (`int`): The number of tokens in the request to the language model.
- **Response_tokens** (`int`): The number of tokens received in response from the language model.

## File: `FileAgent.py`

### Description

Implements the `FileAgent` class, which integrates with an asynchronous language model client and utilizes a multi-turn agentic strategy. The class is designed to help process and convert files, particularly those in tabular formats.

### Key Components

- **AioLlmClient**: Asynchronous client for interacting with a language model.
- **AgenticStrategyV2**: Multi-turn dialog strategy for task execution.
- **Tools**: 
  - `FileViewTool` and `FindTextTool` for file operations.
  - `CSVSQLTool` and `In2CSVTool` for CSV and table data handling.

### Usage

1. **Initialization**:
   - Instantiate `FileAgent` with a dictionary of inputs conforming to `FileAgentInputs`.
   - The constructor prepares the agent configuration based on provided inputs.

2. **Execution**:
   - Call the `run` method to execute the agentic strategy and process the files accordingly.
   - The method returns a dictionary containing the processing result and usage statistics.

### Functionality

- **File Conversion**: Converts tabular files to CSV using `In2CSVTool`.
- **Data Querying**: Employs SQL-like queries on CSV files using `CSVSQLTool`.

## File: `__init__.py`

### Description

This file is currently empty, which is common for a package initialization file in Python. This file essentially allows the folder to be recognized as a package for import purposes but contains no executable code or logic.
