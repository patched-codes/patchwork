# Documentation for FileAgent Code Module

## Overview

The `FileAgent` module is part of the `patchwork` package, which provides functionalities for managing tasks related to processing files with a focus on tabular data formats like CSV. The primary goal of these classes is to facilitate interaction with large language models (LLMs) to execute text processing tasks on file data. This documentation covers the key classes and methods, their expected inputs and outputs, and illustrates how they work together to achieve the desired functionality.

## Code Files

### typed.py

This file defines the data structures for input and output types used by the `FileAgent`.

#### Inputs

1. **FileAgentInputs**
   - **task** (str): The description of the task to be performed.
   - **base_path** (Optional[str]): File system base path for the task.
   - **prompt_value** (Dict[str, Any]): Additional prompt-specific data.
   - **max_llm_calls** (int): Configuration value limiting the maximum number of calls to the LLM.
   - **anthropic_api_key** (str): API key for Anthropic, indicating secured access.

#### Outputs

1. **FileAgentOutputs**
   - **request_tokens** (int): Count of tokens used in the request.
   - **response_tokens** (int): Count of tokens received in the response.

### FileAgent.py

This file contains the implementation of the `FileAgent`, which orchestrates file processing tasks and LLM interaction.

#### Class: FileAgent

- A subclass of `Step` which requires concrete input and output types defined in `typed.py`.

#### Constructor (`__init__`)

- **Inputs**: Receives `FileAgentInputs` which include task details and configuration settings.
- **Initialization**: Sets up the file processing strategy using the data provided.

#### Method: `run`

- Executes the processing task.
- **Outputs**: Returns a dictionary with results that include both the strategy execution output and the resource usage (tokens).

#### How to Use

1. **Instantiate** the `FileAgent` with appropriate inputs.
2. **Call** the `run` method to perform the task.
3. **Retrieve** the output, which includes task results and usage metrics.

### __init__.py

This file is an empty file acting as a package initializer. It is standard in Python projects to denote a directory as a Python package.

This module is intended for file processing applications where large files are processed using natural language processing strategies provided by advanced LLMs. It is especially useful in contexts requiring dynamic task execution and interaction with structured tabular data formats.
