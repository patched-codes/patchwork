# Documentation: FileAgent

## Overview

The `FileAgent` module, written in Python, is designed to handle file-related tasks within the Patchwork framework. It integrates language models with multiturn conversation strategies to process and manipulate files, particularly tabular formats like CSV, XLS, or XLSX. This module is part of a larger project structure that appears to be centered around integrating large language models with agent-based strategies to perform specific tasks. This documentation outlines the purpose and functionality of the components within the `FileAgent` directory.

## Components

### 1. `typed.py`

This script defines the required input and output structures for the `FileAgent`. It leverages Python's typing extensions to create structured data classes.

#### Inputs

- **`task`**: A string denoting the task to be performed.
- **`base_path`** (optional): The base directory path for operation, defaults to the current working directory.
- **`prompt_value`**: Dictionary containing additional data for rendering inputs into the task.
- **`max_llm_calls`**: Configurable integer to set the maximum number of calls to the language model.
- API Keys (Configurable, allows alternatives):
  - **`openai_api_key`**
  - **`anthropic_api_key`**
  - **`google_api_key`**

#### Outputs

- **`request_tokens`**: Integer value representing the number of tokens in requests.
- **`response_tokens`**: Integer value representing the number of tokens in responses.

### 2. `FileAgent.py`

This script implements the core functionality of the `FileAgent` class by incorporating language models and toolsets for file operations.

#### Inputs

- The `FileAgent` class accepts inputs as defined in `typed.py` and initializes the task environment. It prepares strategies and configurations for executing files-related operations.

#### Functionality

- **Initialization**: Sets up paths, task rendering, and strategy configurations.
- **Run Method**:
  - Utilizes a temporary directory for intermediate operations.
  - Configures various tools like `FindTextTool`, `FileViewTool`, `In2CSVTool`, and `CSVSQLTool` for file processing tasks.
  - Executes the `AgenticStrategyV2` with the configured parameters and tools, capturing interactions with large language models.

#### Outputs

- The method returns a comprehensive dictionary with execution results and usage statistics of the language model.

### 3. `__init__.py`

A placeholder file to denote the directory as a Python package. It currently contains no implementation.

## Usage

The `FileAgent` is geared towards developers and system integrators looking to leverage advanced AI-driven file processing within their applications. It abstracts complex strategies behind intuitive input configurations allowing for scalable file interactions mediated by large language models.

## Conclusion

The `FileAgent` module provides a robust framework for AI-enabled file operations, facilitating a bridge between complex language model interactions and practical file manipulation tasks within the Patchwork environment. Users can configure and run tasks with a high degree of flexibility, employing various supported API keys for integrating different language models.
