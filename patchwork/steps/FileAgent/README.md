# Documentation for FileAgent Module

## Overview

The `FileAgent` module is a part of the `patchwork` project, designed to automate the processing and manipulation of file data, particularly tabular formats like CSV, XLS, and XLSX. The module interacts with a large language model to perform tasks defined by the user, and it utilizes various tools to process files. The code is structured in three main components: `typed.py`, `FileAgent.py`, and an `__init__.py` initializing the module.

## Files and Their Functions

### 1. `typed.py`

This file defines the input and output structure for the `FileAgent`. It uses Python's type hinting to specify the expected keys and types of values in the input and output dictionaries.

#### Inputs

- `task`: A required string defining the task to be performed.
- `base_path`: An optional string specifying the base directory path for file operations.
- `prompt_value`: An optional dictionary containing additional data for task rendering.
- `max_llm_calls`: An integer specifying the maximum number of calls to the language model (configuration).
- `anthropic_api_key`: A string for authentication with the language model service (configuration).

#### Outputs

- `request_tokens`: Integer representing the number of request tokens used.
- `response_tokens`: Integer representing the number of response tokens received.

### 2. `FileAgent.py`

This file contains the implementation of the `FileAgent` class, which extends a generic `Step` with custom input and output handling.

#### Functionality

- **Initialization**: Sets up the task and strategy with configuration parameters.
- **Execution (`run` method)**: Initializes file processing tools and executes the configured task using a strategic agent. It processes files, converts tabular formats to CSV, and applies other specified tools before returning results.

#### Usage

Users instantiate `FileAgent` with specified inputs and call the `run` method to perform the desired file processing tasks. This class is designed to be flexible, allowing custom tasks to be rendered and executed with defined file manipulation methods.

### 3. `__init__.py`

An empty file that serves as the module's initializer to allow imports from this directory as a package.

---

The `FileAgent` module is well-suited for users looking to automate file handling processes, particularly those involving tabular data transformation and task execution mediated by a language model.
