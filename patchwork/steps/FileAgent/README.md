# Documentation for FileAgent in Patchwork

This documentation provides an overview of the FileAgent implementation in Patchwork, covering the purpose, inputs, and outputs of the relevant code files.

## Overview

The `FileAgent` is part of a larger system designed to process files, typically those with tabular formats like CSV, XLS, or XLSX. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) through the integration of large language models (LLMs) to assist in summarizing and providing structured information. The `FileAgent` makes use of tools and strategies to interact with and process input files, converting them to desired formats, and executing tasks dictated by the user through prompts.

## Files

1. **typed.py**
2. **FileAgent.py**
3. **__init__.py**

### File: `typed.py`

This file defines the input and output data structures used by the `FileAgent`.

#### Inputs

- `task` (str): Required input specifying the task to be executed.
- `base_path` (str): Optional input to set the base directory path for file operations.
- `prompt_value` (Dict[str, Any]): Optional dictionary to provide data for rendering prompts.
- `max_llm_calls` (int): Configurable parameter indicating the maximum number of API calls to an LLM.
- `anthropic_api_key` (str): API key for authenticating requests to Anthropic's services.

#### Outputs

- `request_tokens` (int): Number of tokens needed for the request processing.
- `response_tokens` (int): Number of tokens used in the response.

### File: `FileAgent.py`

This file contains the core implementation of the `FileAgent` class, which inherits from `Step`. It uses various tools and strategies to execute file processing tasks.

#### Constructor

- Initializes the `FileAgent` using inputs from `FileAgentInputs`.
- Sets up LLM client and agent configurations based on the task and available tools.

#### Methods

- `run()`: Executes the main logic of the `FileAgent` using strategy patterns and tools to process files and returns a dictionary with results and usage statistics.

### File: `__init__.py`

This is an initializer file for the `FileAgent` module and is empty, serving as a package marker.

## Usage

The `FileAgent` will typically be used when there is a need to process and interpret tabular files in a structured manner, facilitated by advanced LLM processing. It is suitable for applications requiring automation in tabular data handling, utilizing AI-driven summaries, and conversions especially relevant for data science and AI model operations. 

### Example Usage

Below is an example of how `FileAgent` might be initialized and used:

```python
inputs = {
    'task': 'Summarize the data in the given files.',
    'base_path': '/path/to/files',
    'anthropic_api_key': 'your-api-key',
    'max_llm_calls': 5
}

file_agent = FileAgent(inputs)
output = file_agent.run()
print(output)
```

This would summarize data in files located in the specified directory, making use of provided LLM configurations and tools for file conversion and data processing.
