# Documentation for FileAgent Module

## Overview

The `FileAgent` module is designed to interact with various files, particularly those in tabular formats like CSV, XLS, or XLSX, using a strategy driven by an AI agent. The agent is capable of converting files to CSV format if needed and performs tasks based on textual prompts. It is structured around several classes and utilities to handle input processing, AI interaction, and file management.

## Components

### 1. `typed.py`

This file defines typed dictionaries that specify the structure of inputs and outputs for the `FileAgent`:

- **Inputs**:
  - `task`: (str) The task that needs to be performed by the agent.
  - `base_path`: (str, optional) The base path for file operations.
  - `prompt_value`: (Dict[str, Any]) Dictionary used to format the task.
  - `max_llm_calls`: (int) The maximum number of API calls to the language model.
  - `anthropic_api_key`: (str) API key for using Anthropic's services.

- **Outputs**:
  - `request_tokens`: (int) Number of tokens in the request.
  - `response_tokens`: (int) Number of tokens in the response.

### 2. `FileAgent.py`

The core class `FileAgent` inherits from `Step` and utilizes the defined input and output structures to perform tasks through the `AgenticStrategyV2`. It utilizes various tools to conduct file operations and leverages an AI model to fulfill the requested tasks:

- **Inputs**:
  - Inputs to the class include configurations like model selection, API clients, system prompts, etc.
  
- **Outputs**:
  - A dictionary containing results from executing the strategy and usage statistics.

- **Key Features**:
  - Converts various tabular file formats to CSV using the `in2csv_tool`.
  - Allows executing additional tools via agent configuration.
  - Runs on temporary directories for file operations.

### 3. `__init__.py`

An empty module initializer file, indicating the package structure.

## How to Use the Module

1. **Instantiate `FileAgent`**: 
   Create an instance of `FileAgent` with required inputs that specify the task, file paths, and necessary configurations.

2. **Run the Agent**:
   - Call the `run()` method to execute the agent's strategy. It will process the files as per the provided task, using the defined tools and configurations.
   - Retrieve the results along with token usage statistics.

This module is likely to be integrated as a part of a larger system that requires automated file processing and interaction with language models for task execution.
