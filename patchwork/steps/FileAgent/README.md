# Documentation for FileAgent Module

This documentation details the components and functionality of the `FileAgent` module, which is part of a larger software package. The `FileAgent` is designed to process task-related information and manage files with tabular data, leveraging various tools to analyze and manipulate the data.

## File: `typed.py`

### Purpose
The `typed.py` file defines data structures required for the `FileAgent` functionality using Python's `TypedDict` and `Annotated` types. These are used to specify the inputs and outputs expected by the `FileAgent`.

### Inputs
- **`task` (str):** The primary task to be processed.
- **`base_path` (str, optional):** The base directory path for file operations.
- **`prompt_value` (Dict[str, Any], optional):** A dictionary containing data to be used for task prompting.
- **`max_llm_calls` (int):** Maximum allowed calls to the language model.
- **`anthropic_api_key` (str):** API key for using Anthropic's services.

### Outputs
- **`request_tokens` (int):** Number of tokens used in outbound requests.
- **`response_tokens` (int):** Number of tokens used in responses.

## File: `FileAgent.py`

### Purpose
This file implements the `FileAgent` class, which processes the inputs using a multi-turn strategy to handle and manipulate files. It utilizes several helper tools to aid in file processing and data formatting tasks.

### Features
- **Agent Configuration:** Configures agents to help process files, particularly those with tabular data (CSV, XLS, XLSX).
- **Tools Utilized:**
  - `FindTextTool`: Searches for text within files.
  - `FileViewTool`: Views files in a specified directory.
  - `In2CSVTool`: Converts tabular files to CSV format.
  - `CSVSQLTool`: Executes SQL queries on CSV files.

### How It Works
1. **Initialization:** The class is initialized with input data. It prepares task prompts using provided templates.
2. **Running the Strategy:** A temporary directory is used to execute tasks using a strategy defined by `AgenticStrategyV2`. 
3. **Completion and Return:** The results are aggregated from the strategy execution and token usage data.

### Usage
Engineers and developers working with the `FileAgent` can use it to automate the handling and transformation of data files, primarily in a backend data processing context. This facilitates efficient data analysis and manipulation workflows.

## File: `__init__.py`

### Purpose
The `__init__.py` file serves as the module initializer. It is an empty file in this context but signifies that the directory should be treated as a module.

This documentation provides an overview of the `FileAgent` module's structure and its expected integration in a larger system for managing and processing file data using agentic strategies.
