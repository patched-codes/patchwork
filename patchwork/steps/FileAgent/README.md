# Documentation: FileAgent Module

This documentation provides an overview of the FileAgent module, which includes multiple Python files for handling file operations and integration with large language models (LLMs). The module is designed to assist with file manipulation, particularly for tabular data formats, and can integrate with and utilize various AI models and tools for processing tasks.

## Overview

The `FileAgent` module consists of three primary files: `typed.py`, `FileAgent.py`, and `__init__.py`. The module defines input and output specifications, as well as implements an agent class that can execute tasks involving file operations with the help of LLMs.

## patchwork/steps/FileAgent/typed.py

### Purpose

Defines the types for inputs and outputs used in the `FileAgent`.

### Inputs

- `task`: A string representing the task to be executed.
- `base_path`: *(Optional)* A string path where the files are located.
- `prompt_value`: A dictionary containing key-value pairs for prompt rendering.
- `max_llm_calls`: Annotated integer to configure the maximum number of calls to the LLM.
- `anthropic_api_key`: Annotated string used as a configuration for authentication.

### Outputs

- `request_tokens`: Integer representing the number of tokens requested from the LLM.
- `response_tokens`: Integer representing the number of tokens received as a response from the LLM.

## patchwork/steps/FileAgent/FileAgent.py

### Purpose

Implements the `FileAgent` class that extends a `Step` and performs tasks related to file operations with support from LLMs.

### Inputs

- **Already defined in `typed.py` but utilized here**:
  - `task`
  - `base_path`
  - `prompt_value`
  - `max_llm_calls`
  - `anthropic_api_key`

### Key Components

- **Initialization**: Sets up file paths and renders tasks using the `mustache` template system.
- **Agent Configuration**: Defines the agent and its toolset:
  - Supports tabular file conversion using `in2csv_tool`.
  - Utilizes `FindTextTool`, `FileViewTool`, and `CSVSQLTool` for file operations.
- **Execution**: Runs a defined strategy using `AgenticStrategyV2` with all tools configured and applies LLM interactions.

### Outputs

- Executes the task with the configured strategy and returns a dictionary containing the results and LLM usage statistics.

## patchwork/steps/FileAgent/__init__.py

### Purpose

This file serves as the module initializer but is currently empty. It can be used for future module-level configurations or initializations.

This documentation provides concise insights into the `FileAgent` module's purpose, inputs, processing strategies, and outputs. The module is tailored for developers or users who need to automate file-based tasks with the assistance of advanced language models.
