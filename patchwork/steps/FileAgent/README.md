# Documentation for FileAgent Module

## Overview

The `FileAgent` module is designed to handle specific file processing tasks, particularly involving tabular formatted files such as CSV, XLS, or XLSX. It uses an AI-based approach to process and analyze files. The primary components of this module are defined across three core Python files, each serving distinct roles within the processing pipeline. The module is structured to integrate seamlessly with other components of the `patchwork` library, leveraging AI for efficient file management and manipulation.

## **File: patchwork/steps/FileAgent/typed.py**

### Purpose

The `typed.py` file defines the input and output structures used by the `FileAgent` class. These structures determine the required and optional parameters the agent accepts and what it outputs after processing.

### Inputs

- **FileAgentInputs**: A class derived from `TypedDict`, which outlines the expected inputs.
  - `task`: Required string specifying the task to be performed.
  - `base_path`: Optional string for the base directory path.
  - `prompt_value`: Optional dictionary for additional data inputs to tasks.
  - `max_llm_calls`: The maximum number of LLM calls allowed.
  - `openai_api_key`, `anthropic_api_key`, `google_api_key`: API keys for various services, with conditions applied for configuration.

### Outputs

- **FileAgentOutputs**: A class derived from `TypedDict`, specifying the output details.
  - `request_tokens`: The number of tokens used for the request.
  - `response_tokens`: The number of tokens received in response.

## **File: patchwork/steps/FileAgent/FileAgent.py**

### Purpose

The `FileAgent.py` file defines the main `FileAgent` class used to execute file processing tasks. This class uses AI-driven strategies to handle different file types, convert them, and extract information as needed.

### Inputs

The `FileAgent` class initializes with a dictionary that conforms to the `FileAgentInputs` structure:

- `base_path`, `task`, `prompt_value`, etc., as defined in `typed.py`.

### Outputs

The `run()` method returns a dictionary that contains the result of the execution, merging output data and usage metrics from the AI strategy.

### Functionality

- **Initialization**: Setups file paths and rendering of tasks using a template approach.
- **AI Strategy Configuration**: Uses `AgenticStrategyV2` with a set of tools for processing files.
- **File Handling Tools**: Includes tools like `In2CSVTool`, `FindTextTool`, `FileViewTool`, amongst others.
- **Execution**: Runs the strategy within a temporary directory, employing multi-agent configurations to effectively process and convert files.

## **File: patchwork/steps/FileAgent/__init__.py**

### Purpose

The `__init__.py` file appears to serve as a module initializer, which allows the `FileAgent` directory to be recognized as a package within Python. This file is currently an empty placeholder enhancing package structure.

This module is likely to be used by developers implementing file management systems where efficient processing (especially conversion and summarization) of varied file types is needed. The use of AI aids in automating complex tasks, making the `FileAgent` suitable for enterprise-level applications requiring digital document management and data analysis capabilities.
