# Documentation: FileAgent Component

## Overview

The `FileAgent` component is part of a larger codebase, designed to handle files, particularly those with tabular formats such as CSVs, XLS, and XLSX files. This component uses advanced tools and strategies to accomplish tasks given by users in the form of prompts.

## Files and Components

### `typed.py`

This module contains the type definitions for inputs and outputs used by the `FileAgent`. It utilizes `TypedDict` from Python's typing extensions to define structured data. 

#### Inputs

- **`task`** (str): The primary task that the `FileAgent` needs to accomplish.
- **`base_path`** (str, optional): The base directory path where files are located.
- **`prompt_value`** (Dict[str, Any], optional): A dictionary of values to render the task prompt.
- **`max_llm_calls`** (int, config): Maximum calls allowed for language model services.
- **`anthropic_api_key`** (str, config): API key needed for interacting with external services.

#### Outputs

- **`request_tokens`** (int): Token count for requests processed.
- **`response_tokens`** (int): Token count for responses generated.

### `FileAgent.py`

This module defines the `FileAgent` class, inheriting from `Step`, incorporating both the input and output types from `typed.py`. The main functionality revolves around setting up a task environment using agent strategies and available tools to complete specific file-related tasks provided by users.

#### Key Components

- **`__init__` Method**: Initializes the `FileAgent` with configuration parameters and prepares the execution strategy.
- **`run` Method**: Executes the task strategy within a temporary directory, using various file manipulation tools to achieve the task objectives. This method returns a dictionary containing results and usage statistics.

### Tool Components

- **`FindTextTool`**: Searches for text within files.
- **`FileViewTool`**: Provides file viewing capabilities.
- **`In2CSVTool`**: Converts tabular files to CSV format.
- **`CSVSQLTool`**: Performs SQL operations on CSV files.

### `__init__.py`

An empty file, serving as the package initializer to facilitate module imports within the package hierarchy.

## Intended Usage

The `FileAgent` is intended for complex file manipulation tasks, especially handling tabular data formats. This can be highly useful in data processing pipelines where converting and querying tabular data quickly and efficiently is necessary. The component is suitable for integration into larger systems requiring automated file management and processing.
