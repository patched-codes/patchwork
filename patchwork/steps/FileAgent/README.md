# FileAgent Module Documentation

## Introduction
The `FileAgent` module seems to be a component of a larger system, potentially a file processing or analysis tool. It is designed to interact with and process different types of file data, especially tabular formats like CSV or Excel files. This module is structured across a few Python files, including type definitions and the main agent functionality.

## Files Overview

### `typed.py`

#### Inputs
- **Annotated**: Used for declaring configuration-specific fields.
- **Dict**: Used to define flexible key-value pairs in inputs.
- **TypedDict**: Used to ensure specific types for dictionary-like structures.

#### Classes
- `__ReconcilationAgentRequiredInputs`: Defines a dictionary type with a mandatory 'task' key.
- `FileAgentInputs`: Extends `__ReconcilationAgentRequiredInputs` with optional fields like `base_path`, `prompt_value`, `max_llm_calls`, and API keys.
- `FileAgentOutputs`: Describes the output structure including `request_tokens` and `response_tokens`.

### `FileAgent.py`

#### Purpose
This script implements the core logic of the `FileAgent`. It utilizes tools and strategies for processing and interacting with file data, especially those which are tabular in nature.

#### Key Components
- **Initialization**: Initializes with input parameters and sets up configurations necessary for agent strategy execution.
- **Tools**: Implements tools such as `FindTextTool`, `FileViewTool`, `In2CSVTool`, and `CSVSQLTool` for various file operations.
- **Strategies**: Uses `AgenticStrategyV2` for executing multi-turn interactions guided by predefined configurations and templates.

#### Method
- `run`: Executes the agent strategy with provided configurations, utilizes a temporary directory for intermediate data handling, and returns execution results along with usage stats.

### `__init__.py`

#### Purpose
This file is a placeholder for the `FileAgent` package initialization. It does not include specific logic or definitions directly.

## Usage

### Inputs
When configuring and using the `FileAgent`, users will provide:
- **Task Descriptions**: What's intended to be done with the given files.
- **Base Path**: Directory where files are located.
- **Prompt Values**: Data fed into system and user prompts for specific responses or actions.
- **API Keys**: These are configurational for various API interactions.
  
### Outputs
After executing the `FileAgent`, the user will receive:
- **Tokens Information**: Counts of request and response tokens which could be used for tracking processing usage or costs where applicable.
  
### Usage Scenario
This module seems ideal for a system that needs to automate analysis or manipulation of large datasets stored across various file types. Common scenarios include data cleaning, conversion of files to a uniform format (e.g., CSV), and querying them for specific insights or summaries.
