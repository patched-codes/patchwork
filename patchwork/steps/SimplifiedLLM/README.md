The provided code consists of a Python module that defines data types for inputs and outputs related to a `SimplifiedLLM` step in a larger system. The types are mainly defined in the `typed.py` file, while the logic for processing these inputs and generating outputs is implemented in the `SimplifiedLLM.py` file.

Data types are defined for `SimplifiedLLMInputs`, `SimplifiedLLMOutputs`, and related structures using `TypedDict`. These data types are annotated with configuration information and are used for defining required and optional inputs for the `SimplifiedLLM` step.

The `SimplifiedLLM` class in `SimplifiedLLM.py` implements the processing logic. It checks for required inputs, prepares prompts, calls an LLM (Language Model), extracts responses based on the model type (JSON or text), and returns the final set of prompts and responses. The class makes use of other step classes (`PreparePrompt`, `CallLLM`, `ExtractModelResponse`) to handle specific tasks within the `SimplifiedLLM` process.

### Inputs
The inputs for the `SimplifiedLLM` step include information like user prompts, system prompts, model details, API keys, and response formatting settings. These inputs are structured according to the defined data types in `typed.py`.

### Outputs
The `SimplifiedLLM` step generates outputs related to prompts, model responses, and extracted responses based on the specified configurations and interactions with external services.

Overall, the code provides a structured way to handle the Simplified LLM step within a larger system, ensuring that the inputs are processed correctly and the outputs are generated as expected.
