# Documentation: DatabaseAgent Module

This module is part of the `patchwork` package, specifically handling operations related to database query execution with an AI-driven interface. The primary files within this module are `DatabaseAgent.py`, `typed.py`, and an initializer `__init__.py`.

---

## `DatabaseAgent.py`

### Description

The `DatabaseAgent` class enables interaction with databases using AI models for query execution. It integrates capabilities from a large language model (LLM) to interpret tasks and execute them on a specified database. This class extends from the `Step` class and utilizes several tools and strategies to execute database queries based on user-defined tasks and data prompts.

### Inputs

The primary input to the `DatabaseAgent` class is a dictionary of configurations, encapsulated in the `DatabaseAgentInputs` type. Key components of this input include:

- `task`: The task description that specifies what needs to be executed.
- `db_dialect`: Defines the type of database being queried.
- Database connection details (like `db_driver`, `db_username`, `db_password`, etc.).
- AI configuration details such as `max_llm_calls` and API keys for LLM services.
- Example JSON for query format.

### Outputs

The class produces a dictionary output through the `run` method, which contains:

- Execution results of the task initiated by the strategy.
- Usage statistics, specifically `request_tokens` and `response_tokens` denoting token counts used during execution.

### How to Use

1. **Initialization**: Create an instance of `DatabaseAgent` by providing the required inputs.
2. **Execution**: Call the `run` method to execute the AI-driven database queries and retrieve results along with usage data.

```python
inputs = {
    "task": "Fetch user data",
    "db_dialect": "PostgreSQL",
    "db_username": "user",
    "db_password": "password",
    # Additional necessary configurations
}
agent = DatabaseAgent(inputs)
result = agent.run()
```

## `typed.py`

### Description

This file contains definitions for typed configurations used within the `DatabaseAgent`. These help in ensuring that the inputs and outputs are structured and validated appropriately.

### Key Elements

- **`DatabaseAgentInputs`**: An extension of the `TypedDict` providing structure for all necessary inputs to the `DatabaseAgent`.
- **`DatabaseAgentOutputs`**: Consists of structured output data regarding the execution of database operations including token usage metrics.

### Inputs and Outputs

- Specific types for each field are defined to ensure appropriate data types are passed.
- The `DatabaseAgentInputs` contain optional and required fields to configure database connections.

## `__init__.py`

This file is simply an initializer for the Python package. It currently does not define or import anything, serving the purpose of marking the directory as a package.

By understanding these components, developers can easily integrate AI-powered database query execution within their applications, leveraging the `DatabaseAgent` to simplify database interactions using natural language task descriptions.
