# DatabaseAgent Module Documentation

The `DatabaseAgent` module is designed to execute database query operations utilizing an agentic strategy involving large language models and tools. This module primarily serves as an interface between a database and a language model to facilitate data retrieval and task execution.

## Overview

The module contains several key components:

- **DatabaseAgent**: The main class that configures and executes the database agent strategy.
- **DatabaseAgentInputs & DatabaseAgentOutputs**: Typed dictionaries that define the expected input and output structures for the `DatabaseAgent`.
- **Initialization**: An empty `__init__.py` making the module importable.

## Code Components

### File: DatabaseAgent.py

#### Primary Class: `DatabaseAgent`

The `DatabaseAgent` class inherits from the `Step` class and is responsible for executing an agentic strategy using language models to perform database queries.

#### Inputs

- **prompt_value**: A dictionary for dynamic content in the prompt.
- **task**: A string template rendered with `prompt_value` to define tasks.
- **db_dialect**: The database dialect/engine to use.
- **llm_client**: Initializes a language model client using the asynchronous `AioLlmClient`.
- **task configuration**: Configures the reasoning strategy of the agent, leveraging an AgentConfig.
  
#### Outputs

- Returns a dictionary containing the execution result and usage metrics of the agentic strategy. Specifically, it provides:
  - **request_tokens**: The number of tokens sent in the request.
  - **response_tokens**: The number of tokens received from the response.

#### Usage

This class would be instantiated with specific database and task parameters and then execute its `run()` method to perform operations, logging the data execution tasks and associated metrics.

### File: typed.py

#### Classes: `DatabaseAgentInputs` and `DatabaseAgentOutputs`

- **DatabaseAgentInputs**: Defines possible inputs with required and optional fields, including database connection details, API keys, and example data.
  
- **DatabaseAgentOutputs**: Structures the expected output, primarily focusing on token usage during the data execution process.

### File: __init__.py

This file is an empty initializer to allow importing of the module components.

## Use Cases

The `DatabaseAgent` is intended for integration in larger systems where automated and intelligent database querying is required. Researchers and developers could employ this tool for tasks demanding dynamic, context-aware interactions with databases, possibly for analytics, reporting, or data mining functions.

Overall, this module simplifies the process of querying databases by employing a smart agent that abstracts interactions through structured prompts and agent strategies.
