# DatabaseAgent Module Documentation

## Overview

The `DatabaseAgent` module is designed to facilitate interaction with databases through natural language processing. It leverages an agentic strategy to summarize conversations and execute database queries based on user instructions. This module seeks to streamline the process of querying databases by using a conversational interface that effectively interprets and translates user tasks into appropriate database queries. 

The module primarily comprises three files:

- `DatabaseAgent.py`: Defines the core class `DatabaseAgent` and its methods.
- `typed.py`: Specifies the input and output types for the `DatabaseAgent`.
- `__init__.py`: Initializes the `DatabaseAgent` package.

## File: DatabaseAgent.py

### Description

This file contains the `DatabaseAgent` class which extends the `Step` class and includes methods for initializing and executing database tasks with conversational interfaces.

### Inputs

- **DatabaseAgentInputs (TypedDict)**
  - `task` (str): The task description containing requirements for the data to be fetched.
  - `db_dialect` (str): The SQL dialect of the database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
  - `db_driver` (str), `db_username` (str), `db_password` (str), `db_host` (str), `db_port` (int), `db_name` (str), `db_params` (dict), `db_driver_args` (dict): Database connection parameters.
  - `prompt_value` (Dict): Additional data for rendering the task.
  - `max_llm_calls` (int): Maximum number of language-learning model calls allowed.
  - `openai_api_key`, `anthropic_api_key`, `google_api_key` (str): API keys for interaction with respective AI services.
  - `example_json` (str): Example JSON structure to guide output formatting.

### Execution

- **run**: Executes the conversational strategy to perform tasks by interacting with a natural language model and a database query tool, returning a structured result that includes execution metrics.

### Outputs

- **DatabaseAgentOutputs (TypedDict)**
  - `request_tokens` (int): Number of tokens used in the request.
  - `response_tokens` (int): Number of tokens received in the response.

## File: typed.py

### Description

Defines the input and output types for the `DatabaseAgent`. This includes required and optional fields using `TypedDict` to ensure type safety and consistency in data handling.

### Inputs

- **__DatabaseAgentOutputsRequiredInputs**: A base typed dictionary that includes essential input parameters like `task` and `db_dialect`.
- **DatabaseAgentInputs**: Inherits from `__DatabaseAgentOutputsRequiredInputs` and adds optional parameters for detailed configuration of database connections and API keys.

### Outputs

- **DatabaseAgentOutputs**: Specifies the structure of the outputs returned after executing a task, focusing on the metrics of the language model usage.

## File: __init__.py

### Description

The module's initialization script typically defines the package-level variables and imports. Although it is currently empty, it sets up the `DatabaseAgent` as a package for utilization in larger software systems.

This documentation is designed to assist developers and engineers in understanding and implementing the `DatabaseAgent` module for applications requiring dynamic and conversational database interaction capabilities.
