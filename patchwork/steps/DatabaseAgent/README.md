# Documentation: DatabaseAgent

## Overview

The `DatabaseAgent` is a component of the `patchwork` library designed to assist with database query execution utilizing an agentic strategy. It leverages language models to interpret tasks and execute queries based on user inputs. The execution utilizes an agent configuration with a language model and database query tools to interact with databases.

---

## File: DatabaseAgent.py

### Purpose
The `DatabaseAgent.py` file defines the `DatabaseAgent` class, which implements logic to process user input, render prompt tasks, and execute database queries using agentic strategies.

### Inputs
- **prompt_value**: A dictionary used to render the task template.
- **task**: A user-defined task that guides the query execution.
- **db_dialect**: Database dialect that specifies the type of database.
- **db_driver, db_username, db_password, db_host, db_port, db_name, db_params, db_driver_args**: Parameters for configuring the database connection.
- **max_llm_calls**: Maximum number of language model calls.
- **API keys**: Keys for accessing AI models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google).
- **example_json**: JSON string used as an example for query responses.

### Outputs
- **request_tokens**: Number of tokens requested from the language model.
- **response_tokens**: Number of tokens generated in response by the language model.

### How it Works
The `DatabaseAgent` initializes by setting up an `AgenticStrategyV2` with configurations including model choice, prompts, and database query tools. It then executes the task up to a set limit, integrating input data like the task description and database details.

The result is a dictionary that combines the output of the execution and the usage details from the `agentic_strategy`.

## File: typed.py

### Purpose
The `typed.py` file defines input and output types necessary for the `DatabaseAgent`. It utilizes Python's typing extensions to accurately describe possible configuration and execution parameters for the agent.

### Key Components
- **DatabaseAgentInputs**: Specifies the configuration requirements and optional parameters for connecting to a database and performing tasks.
- **DatabaseAgentOutputs**: Describes the structure of outputs from executing the database agent.

---

## File: __init__.py

### Purpose
The `__init__.py` file is typically used to initialize a Python package, making directories importable as modules. In this project, it currently serves as a placeholder within the `DatabaseAgent` sub-package. 

This setup reflects common practices but does not currently contain any code.

## Usage Scenarios

- **Integration in Database Systems**: A developer needs to integrate AI assistance for generating and executing database queries.
- **Automating Query Processes**: Automate tasks where natural language descriptions are interpreted and translated into structured database queries.
- **Enhancing User Interfaces**: Creating intelligent systems with querying capabilities in business intelligence tools or customer service platforms.

This documentation provides detailed guidance on the configuration and use of the `DatabaseAgent`, showcasing the robust capabilities of agentic strategies within the `patchwork` system.
