# SendEmail Module Documentation

This module provides functionality to send emails using an SMTP server. It primarily comprises three files, detailed below, which contribute to the sending process. This is part of a larger software infrastructure, potentially used to notify users or system administrators after the completion of a certain task or in workflow automation processes.

## Files Overview

### 1. `SendEmail.py`

#### Purpose

The `SendEmail.py` file defines a class `SendEmail` that inherits from a base `Step` class. It is responsible for sending an email by utilizing SMTP over SSL.

#### Inputs

The class requires specific inputs in the form of a dictionary to function:

- **sender_email**: The sender's email address.
- **recipient_email**: The recipient's email address.
- **sender_email_password**: The sender's email account password.
- **email_template_value** (optional): A dictionary to replace placeholders in the email template.
- **subject** (optional): Subject of the email. Defaults to "Patchwork Execution Email".
- **body** (optional): Body of the email. Defaults to "Patchwork Execution Email".
- **smtp_host** (optional): SMTP server address. Defaults to "smtp.gmail.com".
- **smtp_port** (optional): SMTP port. Defaults to 465.

#### Outputs

- The method returns an empty dictionary. The primary purpose is sending an email, not output generation.

#### How it Works

- Establishes a connection to an SMTP server using SMTP_SSL.
- Logs in using the sender's email credentials.
- Constructs an email using the MIMEText format with optional Mustache template rendering.
- Sends the email from the sender to the recipient.

### 2. `__init__.py`

#### Purpose

The `__init__.py` file in this context is empty but serves to mark the directory as a package. It is a standard Python practice for package initialization.

### 3. `typed.py`

#### Purpose

The `typed.py` file defines structured input and output types using `TypedDict`. This setup aids in ensuring type safety and clear definitions when instantiating the `SendEmail` class.

#### Key Components

- **__SendEmailRequiredInputs**: Defines mandatory input fields required for email sending.
- **SendEmailInputs**: Extends the required inputs with optional parameters for more email configuration.
- **SendEmailOutputs**: An empty TypedDict that symbolizes outputs from the process, though none are currently defined.

## Usage Scenarios

The `SendEmail` module can be utilized in scenarios where automated email notifications are required. Examples include notifying clients or users of completed transactions, sending daily summaries or alerts, and workflow automation where email acknowledgments form part of the process. The use of templated rendering via Mustache allows for dynamic and customized messaging. 

To effectively use the module, a user must provide valid SMTP credentials and configure any specific email details like subject and body, harnessing the templating feature for personalized content.
