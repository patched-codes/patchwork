## Inputs and Outputs
1. **Inputs:**
   - `list`: List of dictionaries.
   - `keywords`: Annotated string configured for step.
   - `keys`: Annotated string configured for step.
   - `top_k`: Annotated integer configured for step.

2. **Outputs:**
   - `result_list`: List of dictionaries returned by the FilterBySimilarity step.


## File: patchwork/steps/FilterBySimilarity/typed.py

- Defines classes for typed inputs and outputs for the FilterBySimilarity step.
- Contains TypedDict classes for defining the required and optional inputs of the step.
  

## File: patchwork/steps/FilterBySimilarity/FilterBySimilarity.py

- Imports necessary libraries like TfidfVectorizer, cosine_similarity, logger from sklearn.
- Inherits Step class and defines FilterBySimilarity class for this step.
- Parses and processes the inputs provided for the step.
- Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity scoring to filter and rank items based on text similarity.
- Sorts and returns a list of dictionaries with the most similar items based on the keyword-vector cosine similarity scores.
