# Patchwork FilterBySimilarity Module

## Inputs
- The `FilterBySimilarityInputs` class specifies the required and optional inputs for the filter by similarity step.
- Required inputs consist of a list of dictionaries (`list`) and a string of `keywords`.
- Optional inputs include a list of strings (`keys`) and an integer (`top_k`).

## Outputs
- The `FilterBySimilarityOutputs` class defines the output structure containing a list of dictionaries with the name `result_list`.

The provided code contains classes and methods to filter a list of dictionaries by similarity of their text fields to a given set of keywords using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity scoring. It involves setting up input types, running the similarity calculations, and producing a sorted list of dictionaries based on the similarity scores.
