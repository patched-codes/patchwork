## Input and Output Data Handling for FilterBySimilarity Step

This documentation provides an overview of the content and structure of three Python files related to a step called `FilterBySimilarity` within a larger system (possibly an ML pipeline).

### Inputs
- `FilterBySimilarityInputs` class defines the expected input structure for the step, including:
  - `list`: A list of dictionaries.
  - `keywords`: A string annotated as configuration data.
  - `keys`: A string annotated as configuration data.
  - `top_k`: An integer annotated as configuration data.

### Outputs
- `FilterBySimilarityOutputs` class defines the output structure for the step, including:
  - `result_list`: A list of dictionaries containing filtered items based on similarity.

### Code Functionality
- The code within `FilterBySimilarity.py` file implements the logic for the `FilterBySimilarity` step.
- It utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between provided keywords and text items in the input list of dictionaries.
- The step function processes the input data, calculates similarity scores, and returns a filtered list of items based on similarity.
- A logger and several helper functions are used for processing input data and performing necessary calculations.
- The file `__init__.py` is empty, serving as an initialization file for the package but does not contain any code logic.
