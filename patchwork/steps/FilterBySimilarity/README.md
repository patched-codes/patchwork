## Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs**:
  - `list`: List of dictionaries to filter based on similarity.
  - `keywords`: Annotated string containing keywords for similarity comparison.
  - `keys` (optional): Annotated list of strings to specify keys within dictionaries for similarity comparison.
  - `top_k` (optional): Annotated integer to specify the number of top matches to return.

- **Outputs**:
  - `text`: Resulting string after filtering based on similarity using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.

## Description

- **Typed module (`typed.py`)**:
  - Defines input and output types for the `FilterBySimilarity` step.
  - Contains `FilterBySimilarityInputs` class representing the input requirements.
  - Contains `FilterBySimilarityOutputs` class for defining the output of the step.

- **FilterBySimilarity module (`FilterBySimilarity.py`)**:
  - Imports necessary modules like `TfidfVectorizer` and `cosine_similarity` for similarity comparison.
  - Defines the `FilterBySimilarity` class inheriting from `Step` class.
  - Checks for required inputs during initialization and raises an error if any are missing.
  - Utilizes TF-IDF and cosine similarity to calculate similarity scores.
  - Sorts and returns the top matching items based on similarity scores.

- **Initialization module (`__init__.py`)**:
  - Empty file with no code present.

This code appears to be a component of a system that filters a list of dictionaries based on similarity to input keywords, using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity calculations to rank and identify the most similar items. The `FilterBySimilarity` class encapsulates this functionality and provides a method `run` to execute the filtering process. The input requirements are defined in the `typed.py` module to ensure type safety and clarity while using this functionality.
