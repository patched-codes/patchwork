1. `typed.py`: Defines input and output data structures for the `FilterBySimilarity` step.
2. `FilterBySimilarity.py`: Contains the implementation of the `FilterBySimilarity` step that calculates similarity scores based on TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
3. `__init__.py`: Empty file.

## Outputs
The main functionality of the provided code is to perform filtering based on similarity rankings of texts with respect to given keywords. It calculates the similarity between input texts and the provided keywords to rank them, returning a list of top scored items.
