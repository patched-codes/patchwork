## File: patchwork/steps/FilterBySimilarity/typed.py

- Defines input and output data types for the `FilterBySimilarity` step.
- Input fields: 'list', 'keywords', 'keys', 'top_k'.
- Output fields: 'result_list'.

## File: patchwork/steps/FilterBySimilarity/FilterBySimilarity.py

- Implements the `FilterBySimilarity` step that filters a list of items based on their similarity to a set of keywords.
- Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity calculations.
- The step initializes with input values, parses keys, and runs the similarity filtering logic.
- Contains functions for parsing keys and calculating similarity scores.
- Sorts items based on average similarity scores and returns the top-k items.

Overall, these files provide the necessary classes and functions to perform similarity-based filtering on a list of items. The `FilterBySimilarity` step compares text fields of the items with a given set of keywords to determine similarity and outputs a filtered list of items based on the top-k matches.
