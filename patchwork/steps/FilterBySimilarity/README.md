## Inputs
### File: patchwork/steps/FilterBySimilarity/typed.py
- Two typed dictionary classes are defined: `FilterBySimilarityRequiredInputs` and `FilterBySimilarityInputs`.
- `FilterBySimilarityRequiredInputs` contains keys `list` and `keywords`.
- `FilterBySimilarityInputs` extends `FilterBySimilarityRequiredInputs` with additional keys `keys` and `top_k`.

## Outputs
### File: patchwork/steps/FilterBySimilarity/FilterBySimilarity.py
- A class `FilterBySimilarity` is defined as a subclass of `Step` with specific input and output classes.
- The class takes a list of items, keywords, optional keys, and top-k parameter as inputs.
- The `run` method uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to filter items based on similarity to keywords.
- The output is a dictionary with a list of items sorted by their average similarity score to the keywords, limited by `top_k`.

## Description
- The code consists of a step in a system designed to filter items by their similarity to given keywords.
- It utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity for this task.
- The main logic is encapsulated in the `FilterBySimilarity` class.
- Input parameters such as list of items, keywords, keys, and top-k are crucial for determining the filtering process.
