# Code Documentation

## Inputs
- **File 1: patchwork/steps/FilterBySimilarity/typed.py**
  - Defines input and output types for the `FilterBySimilarity` step including the required inputs like `list` and `keywords`, and additional optional inputs like `keys` and `top_k`.

## Outputs
- **File 2: patchwork/steps/FilterBySimilarity/FilterBySimilarity.py**
  - Implements a `FilterBySimilarity` step class that inherits from `Step` and defines the `run` method to run the step.
  - Performs text similarity filtering based on TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
  - Handles input parsing and filtering logic based on inputs provided.
  - Returns the filtered list of items based on text similarity scores.

## Additional Information
- **File 3: patchwork/steps/FilterBySimilarity/__init__.py**
  - Empty file, serves as an initialization file for the module.

This code segment consists of classes and functions related to filtering items based on text similarity. It provides structured input/output definitions and a step class for executing the filtering process.
