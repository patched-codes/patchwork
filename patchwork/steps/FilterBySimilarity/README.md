# Code Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the code related to FilterBySimilarity functionality in a Python project under the `patchwork` module.

- **[patchwork/steps/FilterBySimilarity/typed.py](#patchworkstepsFilterBySimilaritytyped.py)**
  - Defines typed data structures used for filtering by similarity in the project.

- **[patchwork/steps/FilterBySimilarity/FilterBySimilarity.py](#patchworkstepsFilterBySimilarityFilterBySimilarity.py)**
  - Contains the main logic for filtering by similarity by implementing the `FilterBySimilarity` class.
  - The class utilizes text vectorization and cosine similarity to filter a list of items based on their similarity to provided keywords.
  - Parses input keys and runs the filtering process with a specified top_k number of items to return.

- **[patchwork/steps/FilterBySimilarity/__init__.py](#patchworkstepsFilterBySimilarity__init__.py)**
  - An empty file.

### Inputs
- Input parameters are provided to the `FilterBySimilarity` class in the `FilterBySimilarityInputs`.

### Outputs
- The output of the `FilterBySimilarity` class is returned in the `FilterBySimilarityOutputs` data structure, containing a list of filtered items based on similarity scores.
