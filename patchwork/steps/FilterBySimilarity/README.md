# Documentation for Patchwork FilterBySimilarity Module

This documentation provides an overview of the codes related to the FilterBySimilarity functionality within the Patchwork project.

## patchwork/steps/FilterBySimilarity/typed.py

- This file contains type definitions for the inputs and outputs of the FilterBySimilarity functionality.
- It specifies input requirements and output structure through TypedDict and Annotated types.

## patchwork/steps/FilterBySimilarity/FilterBySimilarity.py

- This file implements the FilterBySimilarity functionality.
- It uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to filter items based on their similarity to a given set of keywords.
- The code defines a class `FilterBySimilarity` that extends the `Step` class from Patchwork and utilizes the input and output types defined in `typed.py`.
- The `run` method executes the similarity filtering logic, sorting the items based on similarity scores and returning a subset of items with the highest similarity.
- The class also includes methods for parsing keys and handling skipped steps if the input list is empty.

## patchwork/steps/FilterBySimilarity/__init__.py

- This file does not contain any code.

Inputs:
- The `FilterBySimilarity` functionality requires a list of dictionaries containing items to be filtered and a set of keywords to compare against.
- Additional optional inputs include keys to specify specific fields in the items for comparison and a top_k parameter to limit the number of resulting similar items.

Outputs:
- The output of the `FilterBySimilarity` functionality is a dictionary with a key 'result_list' containing a list of dictionaries representing the filtered items based on similarity scores.
