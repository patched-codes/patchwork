# Documentation for Patchwork FilterBySimilarity Module

## Inputs
- In the `typed.py` file, defines the required and optional inputs for the `FilterBySimilarity` class.
- Required inputs:
  - `list`: List of dictionaries.
  - `keywords`: A string annotated with StepTypeConfig as a configuration input.
- Optional inputs:
  - `keys`: List of strings annotated with StepTypeConfig as a configuration input.
  - `top_k`: An integer annotated with StepTypeConfig as a configuration input.

## Outputs
- In the `typed.py` file, defines the output structure for the `FilterBySimilarity` class.
- Output:
  - `result_list`: List of dictionaries containing the filtered items based on similarity scores.

## File: patchwork/steps/FilterBySimilarity/typed.py
- Contains type definitions for inputs and outputs of the `FilterBySimilarity` class.

## File: patchwork/steps/FilterBySimilarity/FilterBySimilarity.py
- Contains the implementation of the `FilterBySimilarity` class.
- Utilizes TF-IDF Vectorizer and cosine similarity for calculating similarity scores.
- Filters items based on their similarity to provided keywords and sorts them by similarity score.
- Skip the step if the input list is empty.
- Provides the filtered result list based on the top-k similarity scores.
