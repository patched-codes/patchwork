## Inputs

- **FilterBySimilarityRequiredInputs**:
  - `list`: List of dictionaries
  - `keywords`: Annotated string with StepTypeConfig set to `is_config=True`

- **FilterBySimilarityInputs** (inherits from FilterBySimilarityRequiredInputs):
  - `keys`: Annotated string with StepTypeConfig set to `is_config=True`
  - `top_k`: Annotated integer with StepTypeConfig set to `is_config=True`

## Outputs

- **FilterBySimilarityOutputs**:
  - `result_list`: List of dictionaries

## Description
The provided code consists of multiple Python files related to a step called `FilterBySimilarity`. The `typed.py` file defines input and output type annotations for the step. The `FilterBySimilarity.py` file contains the implementation for the step, where it calculates the similarity scores between text items and provided keywords using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. It sorts the items based on similarity score and returns the top `k` items with their scores in the output.

This step can be used within a larger system or pipeline where filtering based on textual similarity is required. The step configuration involves providing a list of dictionaries, keywords to compare against, optional keys to consider in each dictionary, and the number of top matches desired.
