# Code Documentation

This code defines classes and methods for the `FilterBySimilarity` step in a Patchwork workflow.

## Inputs
- `list`: A list of dictionaries.
- `keywords`: A string containing keywords for similarity comparison.
- `keys`: A list of strings for extracting specific keys from the dictionaries (configurable).
- `top_k`: An integer indicating the number of top results to return (configurable).

## Outputs
- `result_list`: A list of dictionaries representing the most similar items based on the cosine similarity of text contents.

The code includes type annotations using `TypedDict` and `Annotated` for defining input and output types. The `FilterBySimilarity` class inherits from `Step` and defines methods for parsing keys, running the filter operation based on text similarity using TF-IDF and cosine similarity, and sorting the results based on similarity scores.

The code also demonstrates handling cases where keys are missing or texts are not found within the input dictionaries. The `FilterBySimilarity` step is designed to be used within the Patchwork framework to filter items based on their textual similarity to specified keywords.
