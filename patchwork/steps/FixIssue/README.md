# `FixIssue` Module Documentation

The `FixIssue` module is part of the `patchwork` code library, designed to automatically identify and resolve issues in a code repository using machine learning and AI-driven techniques. It utilizes the power of various API keys to execute tasks and analyze code issues effectively.

## Structure

This module consists of three key files:

1. `typed.py`
2. `FixIssue.py`
3. `__init__.py`

---

## File: `typed.py`

### Purpose

Defines the data structures for inputs and outputs used by the `FixIssue` functionality. The data classes are constructed using `TypedDict` from Python's typing extensions to ensure that the inputs and outputs are strongly typed.

### Inputs

- **`FixIssueInputs`**:
  - **issue_description** (`str`): A required field providing a description of the issue to be resolved.
  - **base_path** (`Annotated[str, StepTypeConfig]`): An optional path to the codebase.
  - **openai_api_key**, **anthropic_api_key**, **patched_api_key**, **google_api_key** (`Annotated[str, StepTypeConfig]`): API keys to access various language processing services, at least one of these must be provided.

### Outputs

- **`FixIssueOutputs`**:
  - Contains a list of modified files as dictionaries.

---

## File: `FixIssue.py`

### Purpose

Implements the logic to analyze a code repository and resolve issues using an AI approach. This is achieved by employing the `AnalyzeImplementStrategy` class to handle issue resolution in a structured manner.

### Core Classes and Methods

- **`_ResolveIssue`**:
  - Inherits from `AnalyzeImplementStrategy`.
  - Responsible for analyzing the codebase, identifying the issues, and suggesting changes.
  - Uses regex to parse the AI's response and extract relevant analyses.

- **`FixIssue`**:
  - Inherits from `Step`.
  - Initializes with the setup, checking for the necessary API keys, applying the `_ResolveIssue` strategy, and running the tool set.
  - Utilizes `AioLlmClient` to create a client for interaction with AI services.

### Inputs

The class `FixIssueInputs` is used for inputs as defined in `typed.py`.

### Outputs

The class `FixIssueOutputs` is designed to capture the outputs.

### Usage

To use `FixIssue`, instantiate it with the required inputs and call the `run` method.

Example:
```python
from patchwork.steps.FixIssue.FixIssue import FixIssue

inputs = {
    'issue_description': 'Example issue...',
    'openai_api_key': 'your-api-key'
}

fix_issue_instance = FixIssue(inputs)
modified_files = fix_issue_instance.run()
```

## File: `__init__.py`

### Purpose

This file is empty but serves as a placeholder to mark the `FixIssue` directory as a Python package.

This documentation provides an overview of how the `FixIssue` module can be utilized, what inputs it requires, and what outputs it generates. It is intended for developers integrating intelligent issue resolution into their code management practices.
