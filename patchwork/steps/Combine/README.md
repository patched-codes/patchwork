# Code Documentation: Patchwork Combine Module

This document provides an overview of the `Combine` module within the Patchwork project. It consists of three files - `typed.py`, `Combine.py`, and `__init__.py`.

## `patchwork/steps/Combine/typed.py`

This file defines two typed dictionaries using the `typing_extensions` package:
- `CombineInputs` containing keys `base_json` and `update_json` of type List of Dictionaries or Dictionary.
- `CombineOutputs` containing a key `result_json` of type List of Dictionaries or Dictionary.

## `patchwork/steps/Combine/Combine.py`

This file contains a `Combine` class that extends a `Step` class and is initialized with inputs. The class checks for required data keys, compares input lists, and performs combining operations based on the input data type and structure.

### Inputs:
- `inputs`: Required data inputs for the combine operation.

### Outputs:
- `run()`: Method that executes the combining logic and returns a dictionary with the combined result based on the provided inputs.

## `patchwork/steps/Combine/__init__.py`

This empty file serves as the initialization module for the `Combine` package.

The `Combine` module is designed to facilitate data combination operations, handling various cases of input data structures, and producing the combined output in a structured format.
