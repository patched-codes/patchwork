### Inputs

- **CombineInputs class (typed.py)**: 
  - Defines the structure of inputs required for the `Combine` step.
  - Parameters:
    - `base_json`: Can be a list of dictionaries or a dictionary.
    - `update_json`: Can be a list of dictionaries or a dictionary.

- **Combine class (Combine.py)**:
  - Inherits from `Step` class.
  - Constructor takes `inputs` parameter.
  - Validates if required keys are present in the inputs.
  - Assigns `base_json` and `update_json` to instance variables.

### Outputs

- **CombineOutputs class (typed.py)**:
  - Defines the structure of the output generated by the `Combine` step.
  - Parameters:
    - `result_json`: Can be a list of dictionaries or a dictionary.

### Usage
The `Combine` step is used for combining JSON data provided as inputs following specific rules based on the structure of the input data. The step takes `base_json` and `update_json` as input, which can be either a dictionary or a list of dictionaries. The step then combines the input data according to the structure and outputs a combined JSON structure as specified in the output format. The step handles different cases such as both inputs being lists, one input being a list and the other a dictionary, or both inputs being dictionaries, and combines them as per the defined rules.
