## Code Documentation

### Inputs
- **File: patchwork/steps/Combine/typed.py**
  - Contains type definitions for `CombineInputs` and `CombineOutputs`, including structured input and output data types for the `Combine` step.

### Outputs
- **File: patchwork/steps/Combine/Combine.py**
  - Defines a class `Combine`, which is a step in a larger process.
  - Inside the class are methods for initializing the step with inputs, performing the necessary combination logic on the provided JSON data, and generating the combined JSON output according to the defined rules.
  - The step is built to handle different scenarios based on whether the input JSON data is a list, a dictionary, or a combination of both.


### Usage
- Developers working on a workflow automation system using Patchwork can utilize the `Combine` step within their workflow process to merge and combine JSON data in various scenarios as defined by the class logic.
- The `CombineInputs` and `CombineOutputs` data structures help in maintaining a structured approach to specifying expected input and output data formats for the `Combine` step.
- The `Combine` step is expected to be integrated into a larger framework that governs the flow of execution for different steps, providing a way to combine JSON data in a flexible manner based on the given input scenarios.
