# Documentation for Patchwork Combine Module

## Inputs
- **File: patchwork/steps/Combine/typed.py**
  - Defines classes `CombineInputs` and `CombineOutputs` using `TypedDict`.
  - `CombineInputs` has two keys: `base_json` and `update_json` where values can be a list of dictionaries or a dictionary.
  - `CombineOutputs` has one key: `result_json` where the value can be a list of dictionaries or a dictionary.

## Outputs
- **File: patchwork/steps/Combine/Combine.py**
  - Contains a class `Combine` that inherits from `Step` and implements logic to combine input JSON data based on different scenarios.
  - The `Combine` class constructor ensures all required keys from `CombineInputs` are provided in the input data.
  - The `run` method of `Combine` handles and merges JSON data based on whether input is a list or a dictionary, then provides the combined output JSON data.

- **File: patchwork/steps/Combine/__init__.py**
  - Contains no code, serves as an empty initializer file.
