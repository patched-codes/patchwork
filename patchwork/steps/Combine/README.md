# Combine Module Documentation

This set of code files comprises a `Combine` module that allows combining JSON data inputs in various ways. It includes the following components:

## Inputs

### `typed.py`
- Defines two typed dictionaries:
  - `CombineInputs` with keys `base_json` and `update_json` that can be either a list of dictionaries or a dictionary.
  - `CombineOutputs` with a key `result_json` that can be either a list of dictionaries or a dictionary.

## Outputs

### `Combine.py`
- `Combine` class derived from `Step` that takes the inputs and combines the JSON data based on the specified rules.
- Initializes with `CombineInputs` and checks for missing keys in the provided inputs.
- Defines a `run` method that combines the JSON data in different scenarios:
  - Combines dictionaries if both inputs are dictionaries.
  - Merges two lists of dictionaries based on a specified logic.
  - Appends additional content to each item in a list of dictionaries if one input is a dictionary.

### `__init__.py`
- Empty file.

This documentation provides clarity on the structure, purpose, and functionality of the `Combine` module, aiding developers in understanding and utilizing its capabilities effectively.
