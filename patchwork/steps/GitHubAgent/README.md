# GitHubAgent Module Documentation

## Overview

The `GitHubAgent` module constitutes part of a Python package and consists of three main files providing functionality for interacting with GitHub through an agent-based strategy. It leverages an AI language model to execute tasks via the GitHub CLI interface, rendering it suitable for automation of GitHub-related operations.

The system is designed to facilitate communication between a user and a simulated senior software developer (agent) that performs tasks using GitHub. The module is structured with defined input and output schema to ensure robust configuration and output delivery.

## Files

### 1. `GitHubAgent.py`

**Purpose**: Implements the core functionality of the `GitHubAgent` class, which extends a `Step` and utilizes an agentic strategy to interact with GitHub using CLI commands.

#### Inputs
- **base_path**: The directory path used as the context for GitHub operations; defaults to the current working directory.
- **task**: A string defining the task to be executed by the agent.
- **prompt_value**: An optional dictionary for task-specific data.
- **github_api_token**: A token required for authenticating GitHub CLI interactions.
- **example_json**: An optional example JSON structure defining expected outputs.

#### Outputs
- A dictionary combining the execution result of the task and the usage statistics of the agentic operation.

#### Usage
This file sets up an `AgenticStrategyV2` instance, configuring it with models and templates for performing GitHub operations by executing tasks specified in plain language, making use of a GitHubTool initialized with the provided API token.

### 2. `typed.py`

**Purpose**: Defines the input and output data structures used by the `GitHubAgent` class.

#### Inputs
- **task**: A mandatory task description string.
- **base_path**: Optional; defaults to Path.cwd().
- **prompt_value**: Optional dictionary for placeholder values in the task prompt.
- **max_llm_calls**: Configurable integer for limiting language model usage.
- API Key Annotations: Configuration is allowed through `openai_api_key`, `anthropic_api_key`, `google_api_key`, `client_is_gcp`, and their logical combinations.

#### Outputs
- **request_tokens**: Number of tokens requested during interaction.
- **response_tokens**: Number of tokens in the response from the agent.

### 3. `__init__.py`

**Purpose**: This file serves as the package initializer. It is empty but typically used to import or expose classes and functions across the module, ensuring the module adheres to standard Python package structuring.

## Usage Guide

The `GitHubAgent` module can be integrated into larger systems requiring automated GitHub operations. It can be configured with task descriptions and API keys to allow an AI-driven agent to execute GitHub CLI tasks, making operations consistent, repeatable, and seamlessly integrated into workflows requiring automated source control interactions.
