# GitHubAgent Documentation

## Overview

The `GitHubAgent` class is a component of a Python-based system that facilitates interaction with the GitHub CLI through an agentic strategy. This tool is designed to assist users, specifically software developers and program managers, in obtaining and manipulating data from GitHub using an AI-driven approach. The class leverages various client and utility modules designed for asynchronous operations and data handling.

## Files

### 1. GitHubAgent.py

This is the main implementation file for the `GitHubAgent` class. It handles initializing and running the agent strategy to perform tasks using the GitHub CLI.

#### Dependencies
- `AioLlmClient`: Handles asynchronous LLM interactions.
- `AgenticStrategyV2`: A strategy pattern for defining how the AI agent interacts with tasks.
- `GitHubTool`: Interface for the GitHub CLI.
- `mustache_render`: Utility for rendering textual templates.
- `Step`: Base class for defining steps with inputs and outputs.
- Typed input/output classes from `typed.py`.

#### Inputs
- **GitHubAgentInputs**: A data class defining necessary and optional inputs.
  - `github_api_key`: API key for GitHub access (required).
  - `task`: Task description to execute (required).
  - `base_path`: Path for local operations (default: current working directory).
  - `prompt_value`: Dictionary for rendering prompts.
  - `example_json`: Example structure for output.
  - Authentication keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc., following a flexible configuration pattern.

#### Outputs
- **GitHubAgentOutputs**: A data class capturing execution results.
  - `request_tokens`: Token count sent in requests.
  - `response_tokens`: Token count received in responses.

#### Usage
A user creates an instance of `GitHubAgent` with necessary inputs and calls `.run()` to execute a defined task using GitHub CLI. The method will return a dictionary with execution details and token usage for monitoring purposes.

### 2. typed.py

This file contains type definitions for input and output data structures required by the `GitHubAgent` class. It includes structured configurations using Python's `TypedDict` and annotations to ensure clarity and enforce data contracts. This file supports the main GitHubAgent functionality by providing a clear definition of expected inputs and outputs.

#### Primary Components
- **GitHubAgentInputs**: Extends structured inputs with required and optional fields, employing configuration capabilities for flexible API key usage.
- **GitHubAgentOutputs**: Describes the expected output structure of the execution.

### 3. __init__.py

An empty initializer file to signalize the `GitHubAgent` directory as a module. It does not currently include any specific startup logic or dependencies.

This documentation lays out the structure and usage considerations for the `GitHubAgent` module, aiding developers in understanding and integrating this tool into their workflows for enhanced automation of GitHub-related tasks.
