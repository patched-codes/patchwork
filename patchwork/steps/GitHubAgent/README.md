# `GitHubAgent` Module Documentation

This documentation details the functionality and usage of the `GitHubAgent` module, which is part of a larger codebase dealing with automating tasks using GitHub and language learning models (LLM).

## Overview

The `GitHubAgent` module is designed to facilitate tasks involving the GitHub CLI, leveraging LLMs to help automate and manage interactions. This module implements an agent strategy that takes specific inputs, processes them, and generates outputs, ideal for developers looking to integrate GitHub data retrieval and manipulation into their workflows.

## Components

The module consists of the following primary files:

1. **`GitHubAgent.py`**: Contains the main `GitHubAgent` class, handling the logic for working with user inputs and orchestrating the agent strategy.
2. **`typed.py`**: Defines the input and output data types used by `GitHubAgent`.
3. **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the module (empty in this case).

### Inputs

- **`base_path`**: *(Optional, str)* - Specifies the base directory path. Defaults to the current working directory.
- **`prompt_value`**: *(Optional, Dict[str, Any])* - Contains data to be inserted into a task template.
- **`task`**: *(str)* - Describes the task to be executed using the GitHub CLI.
- **`example_json`**: *(Optional)* - An example structure for the output, influencing the task execution.
- **`github_api_token`**: *(Required)* - The authentication token to access GitHub.
- **API Keys**: Annotated types to configure use of different LLM service providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google (can be configured via multiple configurations).

### Outputs

- **`request_tokens`**: *(int)* - Number of tokens used for the request.
- **`response_tokens`**: *(int)* - Number of tokens received in response.
- **`Other Results`**: Combines outputs from the `AgenticStrategyV2` execution, which includes data obtained from executing the task.

### Functionality

The `GitHubAgent` class initializes an agent-based task execution strategy, employing an `AgenticStrategyV2` object. This involves rendering task prompts and interacting with GitHub via the `GitHubTool`. It automates retrieving and processing data from GitHub specified by a structured task description in a prompt. The execution of the strategy is limited to a maximum of 10 iterative calls.

### Data Structures

- **`GitHubAgentInputs`**: Defines the expected inputs for the `GitHubAgent` class, handling both required and optional fields.
- **`GitHubAgentOutputs`**: Outlines the structure of the output data, specifically focusing on token usage metrics.

### Usage

The defined types help enforce structured inputs and outputs, facilitating error checking and improving the reliability of `GitHubAgent` instantiation and execution.

## File: `__init__.py`

This file is used to mark the directory as a Python module; in this case, it is empty, serving its purpose as a placeholder for module initialization.
