# GitHubAgent Module

This module is designed to interact with GitHub using the `GitHubTool`. It utilizes a large language model (LLM) for agent-based strategies to help execute tasks related to GitHub using a command-line interface (CLI), specifically the `gh` CLI app.

## File: `GitHubAgent.py`

### Description

The `GitHubAgent.py` defines a class `GitHubAgent` that inherits from `Step` and is specifically designed to interact with GitHub using a novel agentic strategy. This class is constructed with inputs that specify the task to be performed, along with configurations for the model and its interaction capabilities.

### Inputs

- **GitHubAgentInputs**
  - `task`: A `str` that describes the task for the GitHub agent.
  - `base_path`: An optional `str` indicating the base path for operations, defaults to the current working directory.
  - `prompt_value`: A `Dict` that contains data for rendering task instructions.
  - `max_llm_calls`: An `int` to configure the maximum number of LLM calls allowed.
  - API Keys (`openai_api_key`, `anthropic_api_key`, `google_api_key`): These are optional and interchangeable keys required for API access.

### Outputs

- **GitHubAgentOutputs**
  - `conversation_history`: A `List` of dictionaries capturing conversation exchanges during the task.
  - `tool_records`: A `List` of dictionaries that log records of tool usage during the interaction.
  - `request_tokens`: An `int` indicating the number of tokens used in the request.
  - `response_tokens`: An `int` indicating the number of tokens in the response.

### Functionality

In the `GitHubAgent` class, the agent is initialized with an agentic strategy and an LLM client. The main functionality revolves around executing a task that involves retrieving data from GitHub using `gh` CLI commands. The process involves rendering task instructions, executing them, and logging the interactions and results.

### Use Case

This class is particularly useful for developers who need a programmatic way to interact with GitHub repositories and perform tasks such as fetching data. The configuration of API keys provides flexibility in choosing the service for AI operations. The ability to automate GitHub interactions makes it apt for continuous integration and development pipelines.

## File: `typed.py`

### Description

The `typed.py` contains type annotations for the inputs and outputs used by the `GitHubAgent` class, leveraging Pythonâ€™s `TypedDict` to define structured input and output.

### Use

This file is crucial for ensuring that the inputs and outputs for the GitHubAgent are correctly structured, allowing for type-checking and preventing discrepancies in data handling.

## File: `__init__.py`

### Description

The `__init__.py` is an empty file and typically serves to mark the directory as a Python package, enabling imports from the `GitHubAgent` module.

### Use

While this file is currently empty, it is a placeholder for potential future setup or initialization code that may be added to the module.
