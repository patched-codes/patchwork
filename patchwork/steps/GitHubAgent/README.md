# GitHubAgent Module Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the `GitHubAgent` module, which consists of several Python files used for interacting with GitHub using an agentic strategy. The files included are `GitHubAgent.py`, `typed.py`, and an empty `__init__.py`.

## Contents

- [GitHubAgent.py](#file-githubagentpy)
- [typed.py](#file-typedpy)
- [__init__.py](#file-initpy)

## File: GitHubAgent.py

This file defines the `GitHubAgent` class, which integrates AI interaction with GitHub using a command-line interface. It extends the `Step` class and uses a strategy for managing tasks via the GitHub CLI.

### Inputs

- **inputs** (instance of `GitHubAgentInputs`): 
  - `base_path` (str, optional): Base path for GitHub file operations; defaults to current working directory.
  - `prompt_value` (Dict, optional): Data for rendering the task prompt.
  - `task` (str): The task that needs to be performed using the GitHub CLI.
  - Configuration Keys: `max_llm_calls`, `openai_api_key`, `anthropic_api_key`, `google_api_key`, `client_is_gcp`.

### Outputs

- **Result** (dict):
  - Contains execution results from the agentic strategy, including:
    - `request_tokens`: Number of tokens used in requests.
    - `response_tokens`: Number of tokens received in responses.

### Usage

The `GitHubAgent` class is used to perform automated tasks on GitHub by utilizing a conversational strategy. It utilizes various APIs for language model interaction and expects the user to provide authentication tokens and configuration options. Developers use this class to automate data retrieval and manipulation tasks on GitHub.

## File: typed.py

This file contains type definitions for input and output used by `GitHubAgent`.

### Inputs

- **GitHubAgentInputs**:
  - **Required**:
    - `task` (str): A description of the task to be executed.
  - **Optional**:
    - Various API keys and configurations that determine how the agent interacts with GitHub and employs language models.
  
### Outputs

- **GitHubAgentOutputs**:
  - `request_tokens` (int): Number of tokens used for requests.
  - `response_tokens` (int): Number of tokens returned in responses.

### Usage

The types defined here ensure that the inputs and outputs of the `GitHubAgent` are structured correctly, making it easier for developers to implement and extend functionality with type safety.

## File: __init__.py

The `__init__.py` file is currently empty and serves as a package initializer for the `GitHubAgent` module. This allows the module to be imported as a package within a larger Python project.
