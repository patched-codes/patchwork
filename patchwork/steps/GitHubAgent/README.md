# GitHubAgent Module Documentation

This module is designed to assist in interacting with GitHub using an automated agent. It leverages advanced language models to facilitate GitHub-related tasks by executing commands via the GitHub CLI. The module is structured into a few key files, each serving a distinct purpose within the application.

## Overview

This set of Python scripts provides a framework for utilizing AI-driven strategies to perform GitHub operations automatically. The main component, `GitHubAgent`, handles the interaction logic, while `typed.py` provides input and output type definitions.

## File: GitHubAgent.py

### Purpose

The primary class in this file, `GitHubAgent`, implements functionality to interact with the GitHub API through a multi-turn, agentic strategy. It utilizes pre-defined strategies and prompts to fetch and manipulate data from GitHub, aimed at assisting software developers in obtaining and handling GitHub data.

### Key Components

- **Imports and Dependencies**: Utilizes modules for AI clients, strategies, and tools necessary for GitHub interactions.
- **GitHubAgent Class**: 
  - Initializes with specified inputs, setting up paths and task configurations.
  - Utilizes the `AgenticStrategyV2` strategy to construct prompts for a language model, specifying task requirements and tool access.
  - Configures an AI model for executing tasks, specifically "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest".
- **Run Method**: Executes the configured strategy to retrieve and process GitHub data, with outputs that include usage metrics.

### Inputs

- `base_path`: The directory path from which the GitHub operations will be performed.
- `task`: A description of the operation or data to be retrieved from GitHub.
- `github_api_token`: Authentication token for accessing the GitHub API.
- API keys for different providers if needed.

### Outputs

- `conversation_history`: A log of interactions carried out by the agent.
- `tool_records`: Records of the tools used during the session.
- `request_tokens` and `response_tokens`: Metrics relating to language model usage.

## File: typed.py

### Purpose

Defines the structured input and output data types used by the `GitHubAgent`. It ensures consistency and clarity in what information is needed and what is produced by the agent.

### Key Components

- **GitHubAgentInputs**: A `TypedDict` specifying possible fields required as input for the `GitHubAgent`.
- **GitHubAgentOutputs**: A `TypedDict` specifying the structure and content of the output data provided by the `GitHubAgent`.

### Inputs

- Includes configurable parameters such as `base_path`, `prompt_value`, as well HTTP API tokens for various services including OpenAI and Google.

### Outputs

- Structures the expected output including conversation history, tool records, and token usage statistics.

## File: __init__.py

### Purpose

This file serves to initialize the Python package but does not contain additional logic or functionality relevant to the GitHubAgent's operation.

### Code

Contains no additional code or comments.
