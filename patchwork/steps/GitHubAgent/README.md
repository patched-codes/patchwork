# Documentation: GitHubAgent Module

This module is part of the Patchwork project and focuses on the implementation of a GitHub automation agent, which is leveraged to interact with GitHub repositories and obtain necessary data through a conversation-based agentic strategy. It utilizes both new and existing machine learning models and tools such as the GitHub CLI.

## GitHubAgent.py

### Description

This script defines a `GitHubAgent` class which inherits from the `Step` class. It integrates several tools and strategies to facilitate GitHub tasks via AI-driven conversations. The agent is configured to execute specific tasks using the GitHub CLI and provides summaries of the actions undertaken.

### Inputs

- **`github_api_key`** (`str`): Required API key for accessing GitHub.
- **`task`** (`str`): The task to be executed by the GitHub agent.
- **Optional Inputs:**
  - **`base_path`** (`str`): The base directory path for operations. Defaults to the current working directory.
  - **`prompt_value`** (`Dict[str, Any]`): Data to be used in task prompt rendering.
  - **`example_json`** (`str`): Example JSON structure showing a summary of actions.
  - **`max_llm_calls`** (`int`): Configuration for maximum large language model calls.
  - **API Keys**: (Can use OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google API keys as alternatives)

### Outputs

- **`request_tokens`** (`int`): Number of tokens consumed during API requests.
- **`response_tokens`** (`int`): Number of tokens in API responses.

### Usage

The class is initialized with the specified inputs and constructs an agentic strategy that simulates interaction with a GitHub repository. The outcome of the agent's actions are returned alongside token usage statistics.

## typed.py

### Description

This file contains type definitions used by the `GitHubAgent`. It defines the structures for input and output data using Python's `TypedDict`.

### Inputs

- **`GitHubAgentInputs`**: A TypedDict class for input validation and structured configuration.
  - Includes fields for API keys, task descriptions, and configuration flags.

### Outputs

- **`GitHubAgentOutputs`**: A TypedDict class defining fields for tracking the number of tokens used in requests and responses.

### Usage

The types defined here ensure consistent and type-safe usage of inputs and outputs in the `GitHubAgent`.

## __init__.py

### Description

This file serves as the package initializer for the `GitHubAgent` module. It currently does not include any code but typically indicates a package directory in Python.

### Usage

Acts as an entry point to load the module's other components correctly when imported.

--- 

By leveraging the components defined in these files, developers can automate interactions with GitHub, execute tasks, and retrieve data programmatically with minimal manual input.
