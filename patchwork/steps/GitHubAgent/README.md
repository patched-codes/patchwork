# GitHubAgent Module Documentation

The `GitHubAgent` module is part of a series of steps in the Patchwork project. It allows users to automate tasks that interact with GitHub, utilizing an AI agent with specific strategies and tools.

## Overview

This module is designed to facilitate interactions with the GitHub API via a command-line interface (CLI). It sets up an agent using the configurable `AgenticStrategyV2` class and allows for task-specific actions through provided user prompts. The agent is capable of summarizing conversations and executing tasks up to a configured limit.

## File: patchwork/steps/GitHubAgent/GitHubAgent.py

### Description

This is the main file defining the `GitHubAgent` class, which extends the `Step` class and uses various inputs and outputs defined in the `typed.py` file. It configures an agent that uses the GitHub Tool to perform specified tasks.

### Inputs
- **`base_path`**: String representing the base path for GitHub operations. Defaults to the current working directory.
- **`task`**: String detailing the specific task for the agent to perform.
- **`prompt_value`**: Dictionary of values to render in task prompts.
- **`example_json`**: Optional dictionary to provide example structures for the agent.
- **`github_api_token`**: Token for authenticating GitHub CLI operations.

### Outputs
- **`request_tokens`**: Number of tokens used in processing the request.
- **`response_tokens`**: Number of tokens used in forming the response.

### Usage

To use the `GitHubAgent`, instantiate it with required inputs and call the `run` method to execute the task. The results will be a dictionary containing execution results and usage metrics.

## File: patchwork/steps/GitHubAgent/typed.py

### Description

This file defines the input and output types for the `GitHubAgent` using `TypedDict`. It ensures the inputs and outputs are well-structured and provides annotations for configuration options.

### Defined Classes
- **`__GitHubAgentRequiredInputs`**: Dict requiring the `task` key.
- **`GitHubAgentInputs`**: Extends required inputs with optional configuration keys such as API keys and prompt values.
- **`GitHubAgentOutputs`**: Output structure including token usage metrics.

## File: patchwork/steps/GitHubAgent/__init__.py

### Description

The `__init__.py` file marks the folder as a Python package. It is empty but ensures that modules contained within can be imported as part of the package.
