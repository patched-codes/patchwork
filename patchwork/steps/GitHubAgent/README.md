# GitHubAgent Documentation

This Python module defines a `GitHubAgent` class that serves as a step in a processing pipeline to interact with GitHub using pre-configured language models and tools. The module consists of three files:

- `GitHubAgent.py`: Contains the main implementation of the `GitHubAgent`.
- `typed.py`: Defines the input and output data types for the `GitHubAgent`.
- `__init__.py`: Empty initializer file for the module.

## `GitHubAgent.py`

### Overview

The `GitHubAgent` class integrates a multi-turn conversational strategy using language models to perform automated tasks on GitHub. It serves as an agent that issues commands via the GitHub CLI under the guidance of a language model.

### Inputs

The inputs to the `GitHubAgent` are managed by the `GitHubAgentInputs` typed dictionary, which includes:

- `task`: A string describing the GitHub-related task to be executed.
- `base_path`: (Optional) The local file path where the operations are contextualized.
- `prompt_value`: A dictionary with additional data for customizing the prompt.
- API Keys for various platforms: These include `openai_api_key`, `anthropic_api_key`, `google_api_key`, and options for determining the client platform.

### Outputs

The outputs returned by the `GitHubAgent` consist of:

- `request_tokens`: The number of tokens used in the request to the language model.
- `response_tokens`: The number of tokens received in the response from the language model.

These are encapsulated in the `GitHubAgentOutputs` typed dictionary.

### Usage

To use the `GitHubAgent`, one instantiates it with `GitHubAgentInputs` and calls the `run()` method. This orchestrates the interaction with the language model and the GitHub CLI to perform the specified task, returning a dictionary with execution details and token usage.

## `typed.py`

### Overview

This file defines the typed dictionaries for the inputs and outputs of the `GitHubAgent`. It ensures type safety and clarity regarding required and optional fields for the agent's function.

### Key Classes

- **`GitHubAgentInputs`**: Inherits from `__GitHubAgentRequiredInputs`, detailing config options and required information for running the agent.
  
- **`GitHubAgentOutputs`**: Describes what data will be exported after executing the agent's task, primarily focusing on the token usage.

## `__init__.py`

The `__init__.py` file is a placeholder necessary to indicate that the directory should be treated as a Python package. It does not contain any functional code.

This module, therefore, allows the integration of conversational AI with GitHub operations, streamlining processes for developers and project managers managing repositories and automated tasks.
