# Documentation for GitHubAgent

## Overview

The `GitHubAgent` module is designed for automating interactions with the GitHub CLI through a senior software developer persona. It performs tasks specified by a user, return relevant data, and ensures that these tasks are executed efficiently and securely with an authenticated GitHub CLI setup.

### Structure

This module comprises three primary files:

1. **GitHubAgent.py**: Implements the core functionality of the GitHubAgent class that integrates with GitHub through an AI-driven strategy.
2. **typed.py**: Defines the structured data types for inputs and outputs to the `GitHubAgent`.
3. **__init__.py**: Serves as the package initializer.

## File: GitHubAgent.py

### Functionality

This file defines the `GitHubAgent` class that extends the `Step` class, using an agentic strategy (`AgenticStrategyV2`) with the help of a language model client (`AioLlmClient`). The `GitHubAgent` handles requests for data using the `GitHubTool` and renders tasks using mustache templates.

### Inputs

- `base_path`: The base directory path for operations, defaults to the current working directory.
- `prompt_value`: A dictionary of values used to replace placeholders in task prompts.
- `task`: A string containing the task description, using mustache templating if needed.
- Authentication Keys: `openai_api_key`, `anthropic_api_key`, `google_api_key`.

### Outputs

- `request_tokens`: The number of tokens used in the request.
- `response_tokens`: The number of tokens received in response.

### Usage

The typical use case involves creating a `GitHubAgent` instance by providing necessary input parameters and executing the `run` method to carry out predefined GitHub tasks. It fetches required data while maintaining communication limits to ensure efficiency.

## File: typed.py

### Functionality

This file contains type definitions used by the `GitHubAgent`. It structures the required and optional inputs using Python's `TypedDict` and `Annotated` for type annotations, especially highlighting configuration-sensitive fields.

### Key Definitions

- `__GitHubAgentRequiredInputs`: Includes mandatory fields such as `task`.
- `GitHubAgentInputs`: Extends required inputs with optional fields like `base_path`.
- `GitHubAgentOutputs`: Defines the expected output structure, focusing on token accounting for requests and responses.

## File: __init__.py

### Functionality

The `__init__.py` file currently serves an initial setup purpose for the package and is empty, providing the necessary initialization for the module in a package structure.

This documentation provides a brief yet comprehensive overview of the primary components and functionalities of the `GitHubAgent` module, aiming to facilitate user understanding and implementation.
