# GitHubAgent Module Documentation

## Overview
This module is designed to interact with GitHub repositories through a command-line interface (CLI) by utilizing an agent-based strategy. It primarily makes use of AI-driven strategies to perform tasks specified by the user on GitHub. This module contains definitions and implementations for setting up and executing tasks on GitHub with the help of comprehensive configurations and API integrations.

## Files and Purpose

### 1. GitHubAgent.py
This file contains the implementation of the `GitHubAgent` class, which encapsulates the logic of initializing and executing tasks using GitHub CLI with an agentic strategy.

#### Key Components
- **GitHubAgent Class**: Inherits from the `Step` class, and uses inputs defined in `GitHubAgentInputs` and outputs in `GitHubAgentOutputs`.
- **Agentic Strategy**: Utilizes `AgenticStrategyV2` to define tasks and formats for communicating with GitHub.
- **Prompt Templates**: Uses `mustache_render` to integrate dynamic data into task descriptions and agent instructions.

#### Inputs
- `task`: The main task string that describes what action to perform on GitHub.
- `base_path`: Directory path for executing GitHub CLI commands.
- `prompt_value`: Supplementary data for rendering the task.
- `github_api_token`: Token for authenticating GitHub CLI usage.
- API keys (`openai_api_key`, `anthropic_api_key`, `google_api_key`) which are optional and can be interchanged based on availability.

#### Outputs
- `request_tokens`: Number of tokens used for the request.
- `response_tokens`: Number of tokens received in response.

#### How It Works
The `GitHubAgent` is initialized with user-specified inputs and configurations, and then executes a task using the GitHub CLI. It combines AI capabilities to effectively interact with GitHub based on the task configuration specified.

### 2. typed.py
This file defines the data types for the inputs and outputs of the `GitHubAgent`.

#### Main Classes
- **GitHubAgentInputs**: Describes the necessary and optional input parameters required for the `GitHubAgent`.
- **GitHubAgentOutputs**: Specifies the structure of the output provided by the agent after task execution.

#### Data Handling
- Uses `TypedDict` and type annotations to ensure the input conform to required types.
- Includes flexibility for different API keys configurations, enhancing interoperability with various service providers.

### 3. \_\_init\_\_.py
This file currently serves as an initializer for the module. It is empty, which implies the current incorporation of packages or modules is simplistic and does not require additional initialization logic.

## Usage
Users can employ this module to automate GitHub operations through command-line interactions. While defining tasks, users can supply specific instructions to the module, leverage various API keys, and expect structured outputs reflecting the outcomes of their interactions with GitHub repositories.

This setup is suitable for developers and managers looking to streamline operations on GitHub using AI-based strategies and automated workflows.
