# CallSQL Module Documentation

The CallSQL module is a part of the `patchwork` library and provides functionality for executing SQL queries using SQLAlchemy. It is structured into three separate files, each playing a specific role in the overall functionality of the module.

## Components

### 1. CallSQL.py

This file contains the main `CallSQL` class which is responsible for executing SQL queries against a specified database.

#### Inputs

- **db_dialect** (str): The database dialect (e.g., `postgresql`, `mysql`).
- **db_query** (str): The SQL query to be executed.
- **db_driver** (str, optional): The specific driver to be used with the database dialect.
- **db_username** (str, optional): Username for database authentication.
- **db_password** (str, optional): Password for the database user.
- **db_host** (str, default 'localhost'): The database host.
- **db_port** (int, default 5432): The port the database is listening on.
- **db_database** (str, optional): The name of the database to connect to.
- **db_params** (dict, optional): Additional connection parameters.
- **db_driver_args** (dict, optional): Extra arguments for the driver connection.
- **db_query_template_values** (dict, optional): Values to render within the query using mustache syntax.

#### Outputs

- **results** (list[dict]): A list of dictionaries representing the rows retrieved by the executed query.

#### Functionality

- **Initialization**: Prepares the SQL query by rendering it with any provided template values, and establishes a database connection.
- **run() method**: Executes the SQL query and returns the results. It handles exceptions and logs the process for debugging purposes.

### 2. __init__.py

This file is an empty Python module initializer.

### 3. typed.py

This contains type definitions used in the `CallSQL` class.

#### Classes

- **CallSQLInputs**: Extends the `TypedDict` with required and optional parameters for creating an instance of `CallSQL`.
- **CallSQLOutputs**: Defines the structure of the output, mainly focusing on the results from the SQL execution.

## Usage

This module can be used by developers needing to execute SQL queries in a Python application with minimal setup. It uses the SQLAlchemy library for database interaction, affording a wide range of compatibility with different database systems and providing robust exception handling and logging capabilities. 

Ensuring proper input is key to the successful execution of the module features, with the `TypedDict` types in `typed.py` aiding in structuring input data effectively.
