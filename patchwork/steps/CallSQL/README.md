# SQL Execution Documentation

This document outlines the components and usage of the code used to manage SQL database connections and queries within the `patchwork` framework. The code spans three Python files located in the `patchwork/steps/CallSQL` directory. These files implement the necessary structures to execute SQL queries and handle the resulting data.

## Overview

This module contains classes and methods for:

1. **Defining Input and Output Structures**: `typed.py` defines strict typing for the input and output structures of SQL operations, ensuring that the necessary parameters are correctly provided.

2. **SQL Query Execution**: `CallSQL.py` implements the main logic to connect to a database using SQLAlchemy, perform the SQL queries, and return the results.

The `__init__.py` file is included for package initialization but contains no code.

## File: `typed.py`

### Description

This file defines typed dictionaries using `TypedDict` to specify required and optional inputs for SQL operations and the expected outputs.

### Inputs

- **Required**
  - `db_dialect` (str): The database dialect to use (e.g., `postgresql`).
  - `db_query` (str): The SQL query to execute.

- **Optional**
  - `db_driver` (str): Specific database driver to use.
  - `db_username` (str): Username for database authentication.
  - `db_password` (str): Password for database authentication.
  - `db_host` (str): Database host address.
  - `db_port` (int): Database port number.
  - `db_name` (str): Name of the database.
  - `db_params` (dict): Additional parameters for the connection.
  - `db_driver_args` (dict): Arguments for the database driver.
  - `db_query_template_values` (dict): Values for query templating.

### Outputs

- **Outputs**
  - `results` (list[dict]): A list of dictionaries representing query results.

## File: `CallSQL.py`

### Description

This file contains the `CallSQL` class, which inherits from `Step`, providing the methods required to execute SQL queries using SQLAlchemy. It connects to a database, executes the query, and handles the results.

### Key Methods

- **`__init__`**: Initializes the SQL step, sets up the query with templating.
- **`__build_engine`**: Configures the SQLAlchemy engine for database connection.
- **`run`**: Executes the predefined SQL query and returns the result set.

### Usage

The `CallSQL` class is to be used by instantiating it with a dictionary of inputs, then calling the `run` method to perform the SQL operation. It logs the results and possible failures for troubleshooting.

## File: `__init__.py`

### Description

This file is used for package initialization but contains no code.

## Conclusion

The code provides structured and reusable tools for performing SQL queries in a defined environment, leveraging type annotations for clarity and SQLAlchemy for robust database interactions. It is intended to be used within the context of the `patchwork` project, facilitating database operations through clear input specifications and output handling.
