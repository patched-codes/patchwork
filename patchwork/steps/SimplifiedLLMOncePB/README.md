## Contents of the Given Code

This code includes typed definitions and implementation for a SimplifiedLLMOncePB step in a patchwork workflow. It consists of three files:

### Inputs
The `typed.py` file defines input types for the SimplifiedLLMOncePB step, including various API keys, model, prompt configurations, and input validation details.

### SimplifiedLLMOncePB Class
The `SimplifiedLLMOncePB.py` file contains the class `SimplifiedLLMOncePB` which extends a generic Step class. It processes the inputs and generates prompts based on the specified configuration before executing an instance of SimplifiedLLM and returning the extracted responses.

### Usage
This code structure facilitates the configuration and execution of a specific step ('SimplifiedLLMOncePB') within a larger AI model generation workflow using Patchwork.
