## Description
This code consists of three files related to the Simplified Long-Short Term Memory Once Personalized Baseline (SimplifiedLLMOncePB) in a patchwork pipeline. 
- The `typed.py` file defines the input requirements for the SimplifiedLLMOncePB step with specific annotations and configurations for various parameters like keys, system prompts, and APIs.
- The `__init__.py` file is empty.
- The `SimplifiedLLMOncePB.py` file contains the implementation of the SimplifiedLLMOncePB step, with methods for schema formatting and processing the input data to execute the step.

### Inputs
The `SimplifiedLLMOncePBInputs` class in `typed.py` defines the required input parameters such as JSON schema, prompt variations, API keys, and system features with specific configurations.

### Outputs
The `SimplifiedLLMOncePB` class in `SimplifiedLLMOncePB.py` processes the inputs and runs the SimplifiedLLM step based on the provided information, returning the extracted responses as the final output.
