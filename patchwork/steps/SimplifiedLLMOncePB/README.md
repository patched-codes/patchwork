## Code Documentation

### Inputs
- The code defines a class `SimplifiedLLMOncePBInputs` that extends `__SimplifiedLLMOncePBInputsRequired`.
- `SimplifiedLLMOncePBInputs` has several attributes like `prompt_system`, `model`, `openai_api_key`, `anthropic_api_key`, `patched_api_key`, `google_api_key`.
- These attributes are annotated with `Annotated` to provide typing information.

### Outputs
- The code contains a class `SimplifiedLLMOncePB` that inherits from `Step` and uses `SimplifiedLLMOncePBInputs` as the input class.
- The class has methods for initializing, generating a JSON schema as a suffix, and executing the step.
- The `run` method fetches inputs and invokes `SimplifiedLLM` to execute the main logic.
- The step's output includes extracted responses from the simplified Large Language Model.

### Usage
- This code seems to be part of a larger software system for running Natural Language Processing tasks.
- It defines the required inputs and logic for running a single instance of a simplified Large Language Model (LLM) prediction with Prompt-Based Learning (PB).
- Users can interact with this code to provide input data and receive processed output in a structured format.
