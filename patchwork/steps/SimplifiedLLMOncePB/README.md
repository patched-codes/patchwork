The provided code consists of Python classes and types related to a step in a patchwork workflow called `SimplifiedLLMOncePB`. The code includes a `typed.py` file containing input types, an `__init__.py` file with no code, and a `SimplifiedLLMOncePB.py` file with the main implementation.

### Inputs
- The `SimplifiedLLMOncePBInputs` class defines input parameters required for the `SimplifiedLLMOncePB` step. These include fields such as `json_schema`, `user_prompt`, and various API keys.
- It extends a base class `__SimplifiedLLMOncePBInputsRequired` and includes optional fields like `system_prompt`, `model`, and different API keys.

### Outputs
- The `SimplifiedLLMOncePB` class implements the step functionality by taking inputs and processing them.
- It includes a `run()` method that generates prompts based on the input schema, executes a `SimplifiedLLM` step with the provided inputs, and returns a dictionary with extracted responses and tokens.

The `SimplifiedLLMOncePB` step seems to involve interacting with a language model (LLM) to process prompts and generate responses based on specified inputs. The code is structured to handle input validation, prompt generation, and interaction with the SimplifiedLLM step.
