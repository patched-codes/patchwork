# SimplifiedLLMOncePB Code Documentation

## Inputs
- In the file `typed.py`, several inputs are defined for the `SimplifiedLLMOncePB` step, including `user_prompt`, `prompt_value`, `system_prompt`, `model`, `openai_api_key`, `anthropic_api_key`, `patched_api_key`, and `google_api_key`. These inputs are typed using `Annotated` with specific configurations.
- The inputs are part of a class `SimplifiedLLMOncePBInputs`, which extends another class `__SimplifiedLLMOncePBInputsRequired` that defines required inputs.
- Additional configurations like alternate options, configurable messages, and `total=False` are added to the input fields.
- The `__init__.py` file is empty, indicating no significant code present there.

## Outputs
- The main functionality of the `SimplifiedLLMOncePB` step is in the file `SimplifiedLLMOncePB.py`.
- The `SimplifiedLLMOncePB` class inherits from a `Step` class and takes input from the defined `SimplifiedLLMOncePBInputs`.
- It initializes with the provided inputs, extracts system prompts if available, prepares JSON schemas, and runs the SimplifiedLLM step with the configured inputs and prompts.
- The `run` method executes the SimplifiedLLM step and returns extracted responses, request tokens, and response tokens in a dictionary format. 

This codebase structures a step in a larger patchwork system for handling prompts and responses, enabling interaction with language models.
